Why is the procedure robust?
Multiple Validation Sources:


The system uses both top-activating sequences and random texts for validation
This dual approach prevents overfitting to just the high-activation cases
Random texts help ensure the explanation generalizes to typical usage


Comprehensive Testing Strategy:


Initial explanation based on top-5 activations provides focused understanding
Validation against both targeted and random samples
Generation of specific test cases to probe edge cases
Revision process incorporating new evidence


Quantitative Validation:


Uses correlation scores between real and simulated activations
Tests both top-activation and random-text scenarios
Sparsity checking (< 20% non-zero activations) to identify specialized neurons


Robust Activation Handling:


Normalizes activations to 0-10 scale for consistency
Tracks maximum activations per neuron
Handles sparse activations specially
Discretizes values to integers to reduce noise


Error Prevention:


Extensive error handling throughout the process
Fallback mechanisms for test case generation
Batch processing for efficiency
Proper handling of edge cases (zero variance, missing data)


Documentation and Logging:


Comprehensive logging of prompts and responses
Tracking of API usage and costs
Detailed reporting of results
Storage of intermediate steps for analysis


Iterative Improvement:


Initial explanation based on clear examples
Test case generation to probe understanding
Revision process incorporating new evidence
Final explanation considers both original and new insights

This approach is robust because it:

Uses multiple validation methods
Incorporates both targeted and random testing
Includes quantitative metrics
Has comprehensive error handling
Documents all steps
Allows for iteration and improvement
