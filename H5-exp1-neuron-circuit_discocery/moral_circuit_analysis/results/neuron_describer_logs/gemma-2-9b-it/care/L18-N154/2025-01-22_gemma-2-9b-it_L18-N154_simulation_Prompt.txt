Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 18, index 154) activates in response to linguistic patterns that emphasize maintaining order, structure, and community integrity, particularly through the lens of social norms, rules, and traditions. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of this neuron's sensitivity to language that pertains to collective harmony and structured environments.

1. **Supported Aspects**: 
   - The neuron's activation in response to tokens related to "rules" and "order" is confirmed. The examples consistently show high activation when discussing the importance of rules and order in maintaining community harmony and safety.
   - The neuron's sensitivity to language involving "collective" and "formal" practices is also supported, as seen in the emphasis on collective understanding and formal events.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - The original explanation suggested that the token "or" connects concepts emphasizing disciplined behaviors. However, the new evidence does not specifically highlight "or" as a significant trigger. Instead, the focus should be on the context in which disciplined or ritualistic behaviors are discussed, rather than the conjunction itself.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron responds to language that conveys a sense of order even in natural or less formal contexts, as seen in the example of the garden. This suggests that the neuron's activation is not limited to strictly formal or ceremonial contexts but extends to any scenario where an inherent order or structure is perceived.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
