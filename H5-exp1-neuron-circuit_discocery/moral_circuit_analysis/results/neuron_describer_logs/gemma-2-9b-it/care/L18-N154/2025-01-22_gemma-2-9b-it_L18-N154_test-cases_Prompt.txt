Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 18, index 154) appears to activate in response to linguistic patterns that emphasize maintaining order, decorum, or community integrity. The underlying theme across the examples suggests that the neuron is sensitive to language that pertains to social norms or practices which uphold collective harmony or structure.

1. **Activation Triggers**: The neuron has a strong response to tokens that relate to rules, formality, and shared societal practices. The specific tokens activated include "rules," "or," "sense," "collective," and "formal," each aligning with this theme:

    - **"rules"**: Suggests the enforcement or application of regulations, hinting at maintaining structured environments.
    - **"or"**: Used here to connect concepts emphasizing disciplined or ritualistic behaviors in contexts like "sacred or solemn spaces."
    - **"sense"**: Refers to the maintenance of a "sense of communal purity," highlighting an abstract concept of shared order."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
