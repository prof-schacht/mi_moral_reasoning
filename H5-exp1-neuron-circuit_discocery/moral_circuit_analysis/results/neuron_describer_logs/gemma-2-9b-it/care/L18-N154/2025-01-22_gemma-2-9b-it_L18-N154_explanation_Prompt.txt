Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 18, index 154) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  rules	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Applying the same rules rules all participants in a

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a respectful silence in sacred or solemn spaces upholds their

Token:  sense	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in public spaces maintains a sense of communal purity.

Token:  collective	Activation: 10.0	Context:  search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety.

Token:  formal	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Using formal titles for formal or community

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
