Prompt Type: revision

=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron, located at layer 12, index 1984, appears to be responsive to tokens that signal conditions, structures, or actions that are often associated with rules, stipulations, or necessities within a context. Let's analyze each example and piece together the pattern:

1. **Token: "be" in "held be for breaking promises":** The token "be" here is used in a passive construction suggesting a necessity or stipulated consequence (being held accountable).

2. **Token: "order" in "a sense of continuity and order":** The token "order" suggests a structural or organized condition within a sequence or system.

3. **Token: "discipline" in "crucial for discipline":** This word points towards a necessary component for maintaining rules or order.

4. **Token: "if" in "quit a job if working conditions are poor":** The token "if" introduces a conditional clause, indicating a prerequisite or condition under which an action might"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The agreement stated that any changes must be approved by the committee before implementation."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "We follow a strict protocol to ensure safety in the laboratory."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Adherence to the guidelines is mandatory for all participants."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In case of emergency, the alarm should be sounded immediately."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "He was required to submit the report by the deadline to avoid penalties."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
