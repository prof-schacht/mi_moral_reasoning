Layer: 28, Neuron: 8428
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 28, index 8428) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  graffiti in public spaces maintains a sense of communal purity.

Token:  their	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to preserve historical monuments maintains their cultural sanctity.

Token:  free	Activation: 10.0	Context:  sacred rivers by keeping them free from pollutants demonstrates reverence.

Token:  protects	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the right to unionize protects their freedom in the workplace

Token:  their	Activation: 10.0	Context:  or solemn spaces upholds their sanctity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
