Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 28, index 8428) appears to be responding to linguistic patterns involving the preservation or protection of symbolic or revered qualities in a context. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern of Activation**: 
   - The neuron consistently activates for tokens that appear within contexts emphasizing preservation, protection, or maintenance of revered or sanctified entities or concepts. These typically include cultural, historical, or environmental elements that are considered valuable or sacred.
   - The activating tokens often function as part of possessive or protective phrases, suggesting ownership or sanctity (e.g., "their cultural sanctity," "them free from pollutants").

2. **Surrounding Context**: 
   - The contexts generally incorporate elements of societal or communal responsibility, where the focus is on upholding or safeguarding traditions, values, or resources. Words like "communal purity," "cultural sanctity," and "reverence" highlight a theme of respect and maintenance"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
