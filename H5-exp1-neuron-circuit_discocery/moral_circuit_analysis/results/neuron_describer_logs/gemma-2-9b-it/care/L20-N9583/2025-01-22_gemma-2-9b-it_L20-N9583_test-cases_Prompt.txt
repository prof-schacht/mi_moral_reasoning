=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 20, index 9583) appears to activate in response to specific morphological and contextual patterns related to constructed or partial tokens, often in the middle or end of words. Here's a breakdown of the pattern this neuron responds to:

1. **Token Analysis**:
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "oring" and "ph," which suggests it is sensitive to partial or fragmented word endings, particularly those that may appear due to tokenization splitting. In modern tokenization systems (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding), subwords like these are common, indicating part of a larger word.

2. **Morphological Patterns**:
   - The partial tokens such as "oring" are likely parts of larger words ending in "-oring," including "honoring," "exploring," "adoring," etc. Similarly, "ph" might appear in processed text as part of "uphold ph," or "ph" might be a standalone fragment used often at mor"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
