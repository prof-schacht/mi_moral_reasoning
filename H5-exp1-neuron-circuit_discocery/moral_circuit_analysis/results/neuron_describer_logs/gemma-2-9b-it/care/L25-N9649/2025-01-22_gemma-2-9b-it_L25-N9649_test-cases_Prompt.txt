Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Upon analyzing the examples provided for neuron activation, the following patterns and concepts emerge that suggest what this neuron (layer 25, index 9649) detects:

1. **Prepositional Phrases and Conjunctions**: The neuron activates strongly with tokens that are either common prepositions (e.g., "for," "in"), parts of prepositional phrases ("in touch with"), or conjunctions ("s" in "one’s," which suggests a possessive form related to structure).
