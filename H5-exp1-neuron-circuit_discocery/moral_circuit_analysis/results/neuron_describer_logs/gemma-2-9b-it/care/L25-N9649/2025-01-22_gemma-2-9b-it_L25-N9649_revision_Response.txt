Revised explanation of neuron behavior for layer 25, index 9649:

Based on the original explanation and new evidence from test cases, the neuron's behavior can be refined as follows:

1. **Prepositional Phrases**: The neuron shows strong activation with prepositional phrases, as evidenced by the high activation in sentences like "She was in touch with her friends" and "Despite the rain, we decided to go for a walk in the evening." This supports the original observation that the neuron is sensitive to prepositional structures.

2. **Possessive Constructions**: The original explanation suggested a sensitivity to possessive constructions, such as "oneâ€™s spouse." The new evidence, particularly the activation in "The cat's whiskers twitched," supports this aspect, although the activation is moderate. This indicates that while possessive constructions do trigger the neuron, they may not be the primary focus.

3. **Continuous Verb Forms and Gerunds**: The original explanation noted activation with continuous verb forms or gerunds, such as "Refraining." The new evidence shows moderate activation with "Running through the park," suggesting that while the neuron does respond to these forms, they are not the strongest trigger compared to prepositional phrases.

4. **Conjunctions and Suffixes**: The original explanation mentioned conjunctions and specific suffixes like "ining." The new evidence does not strongly support this aspect, as sentences with conjunctions or similar suffixes do not
