=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron 10231 in layer 14 appears to respond to linguistic patterns related to ideas of fairness, inclusivity, and compliance with societal norms or expectations. Let's break down the observed patterns:

1. **Equality and Fairness Themes**: 
   - In the sentence "a committee should each have one vote to reflect equality," the activation occurs at "one," emphasizing the concept of equal representation and fairness. The context involves a collective action promoting balance.
   - In "Sharing credit fairly for a group project ensures everyone," the activation on "a" introduces a sentiment of equitable distribution and acknowledgment, reinforcing the concept of fairness.

2. **Compliance and Norms**:
   - The token "lawful" in "Voluntarily submitting to lawful search at security checkpoints" pertains to respecting established rules or legal standards. Here, the neuron responds to adherence to societal norms.
   - In "Joining family celebrations even when itâ€™s inconvenient shows," the activation on ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Every team member should receive equal recognition for their contributions to ensure a just outcome."

Text: "Abiding by traffic rules is essential for maintaining order and safety on the roads."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The new policy promotes inclusivity by ensuring all voices are heard during decision-making processes."

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
