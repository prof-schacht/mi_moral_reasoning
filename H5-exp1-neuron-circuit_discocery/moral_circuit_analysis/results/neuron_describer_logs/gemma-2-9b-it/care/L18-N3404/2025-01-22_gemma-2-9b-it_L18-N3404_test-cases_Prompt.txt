Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron's activation pattern suggests that it is sensitive to prepositions and conjunctions that are pivotal in indicating purpose, relationships, or contrasts within a sentence. Let's break down the specific activations:

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions as Connectors**: The neuron consistently activates on prepositions ("from," "for," "to") and conjunctions ("or," "out"). These words all serve as crucial connectors that establish relationships between different parts of a sentence. They often help transition from a subject to an action or a condition to a consequence, indicating that the neuron is attuned to these functional roles.

2. **Purpose and Consequence**: Many of the examples show these tokens used in contexts where they define purpose, benefits, or consequences:
   - "from slaughter" indicates a goal or purpose of protection.
   - "for local matches" indicates the purpose of being present.
   - "to a to in court" suggests an action (speaking politely) with a"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
