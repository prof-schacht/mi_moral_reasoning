Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron's activation pattern suggests that it is sensitive to prepositions and conjunctions that are pivotal in indicating purpose, relationships, or contrasts within a sentence. Let's break down the specific activations:

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions as Connectors**: The neuron consistently activates on prepositions ("from," "for," "to") and conjunctions ("or," "out"). These words all serve as crucial connectors that establish relationships between different parts of a sentence. They often help transition from a subject to an action or a condition to a consequence, indicating that the neuron is attuned to these functional roles.

2. **Purpose and Consequence**: Many of the examples show these tokens used in contexts where they define purpose, benefits, or consequences:
   - "from slaughter" indicates a goal or purpose of protection.
   - "for local matches" indicates the purpose of being present.
   - "to a to in court" suggests an action (speaking politely) with a"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "She traveled from Paris to Madrid for a conference, highlighting her purpose-driven journey."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The project was designed to improve efficiency, but it ended up offering more challenges than solutions."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "He studied late into the night so that he could ace the exam, demonstrating a clear cause-and-effect relationship."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The meeting was scheduled at noon, yet no one showed up, illustrating a contrast between expectation and reality."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The cat jumped over the wall to catch the bird, a classic example of action driven by purpose."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
