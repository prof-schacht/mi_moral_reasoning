Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron's activation pattern indicates a nuanced sensitivity to linguistic elements that convey purpose, relationships, and contrasts within sentences. The new evidence supports some aspects of the original explanation while revealing additional nuances:

1. **Sensitivity to Purpose and Cause-Effect Relationships**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where prepositions and conjunctions highlight purpose or cause-effect relationships. For instance, in "She traveled from Paris to Madrid for a conference," the neuron's high activation (7.000) aligns with the original explanation, as the prepositions "from," "to," and "for" clearly delineate a purpose-driven journey. Similarly, "He studied late into the night so that he could ace the exam" (activation 6.000) underscores a cause-effect relationship, supporting the neuron's sensitivity to purpose and consequence.

2. **Contrast and Expectation**: The neuron also activates strongly in contexts illustrating contrast or unmet expectations, as seen in "The meeting was scheduled at noon, yet no one showed up" (activation 7.000). This suggests that the neuron is attuned not only to purpose but also to contrasts, which was not fully captured in the original explanation.

3. **Moderate Activation in Complex Relationships**: In "The project was designed to improve efficiency, but it ended up offering more challenges than solutions" (activation 3.000), the neuron's moderate activation indicates a sensitivity to complex relationships involving contrasts and unintended consequences. This"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
