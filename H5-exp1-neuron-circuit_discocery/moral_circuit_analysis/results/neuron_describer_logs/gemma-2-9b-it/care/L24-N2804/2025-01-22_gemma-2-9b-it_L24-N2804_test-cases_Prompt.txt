=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 24, index 2804) appears to be highly sensitive to a pattern involving repeated sequences or potential redundancies and certain noun forms that are contextually notable or carry specific connotations.

1. **Repetition or Redundancy Detection:**
   - In the activations like "a a" and "be be," the neuron responds to a repetition of small words that usually indicate an editing error, emphasis, or a typo. This suggests that the neuron is attentive to unusual or redundant repetitions of tokens in text that typically should not be repeated.

2. **Context-Sensitive Noun Forms:**
   - The tokens like "offenses," "rescued," and "years" hint at nouns or participles that carry specific thematic or contextual weight, often related to legal terms (offenses), animal welfare (rescued), or time duration (years). These nouns/verbs could be part of phrases that hold broader significance or implications in sentences, often contributing important semantic"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
