Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 22, index 9482, demonstrates a nuanced sensitivity to tokens associated with the foundational or essential aspects of concepts, particularly those that emphasize ideological or philosophical significance. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Sensitivity to Foundational Concepts**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where the text emphasizes foundational or essential principles, as seen in "The foundation of their argument rested on the indisputable value of freedom of speech" (activation: 10.000). This suggests that the neuron is particularly responsive to tokens that highlight the core or underlying basis of an idea or argument, especially when these are framed as indisputable or fundamental.

2. **Selective Activation on Core Values**:
   - While the original explanation suggested a broad sensitivity to core values or principles, the new evidence indicates a more selective activation. For instance, "The essence of courage lies in the unwavering belief in one's principles" (activation: 5.000) supports the neuron's focus on core values, but "Her dedication to truth and integrity was the cornerstone of her character" (activation: 0.000) does not trigger the neuron, suggesting that not all expressions of values or principles activate it equally.

3. **Contextual Importance and Cultural Significance**:
   - The neuron activates moderately with tokens that denote cultural or historical significance, as in "The ancient artifact was considered a sacred relic, symbolizing
