=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 23, index 4010) appears to detect contexts that signify the completion or formal recognition of significant concepts, often through punctuation or specific word choices.

1. **Triggering Pattern**: This neuron activates strongly in the presence of tokens that demarcate or conclude notable entities or concepts. The highest activations occur with:
   - Words or suffixes like "ations" (as in "graduations"), which often denote a process reaching completion or a formal state.
   - Words like "address" in formal contexts, suggesting recognition of social norms or roles.
   - Periods (.), which denote the end of a sentence, and thus the end or significant pause in expressing a thought.

2. **Context Examination**:
   - In the case of "ations", the context suggests milestones or formal events ("graduations"), indicating the neuron's sensitivity to words signifying culmination or formality.
   - The activation with "address" is tied to its formal use,"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
