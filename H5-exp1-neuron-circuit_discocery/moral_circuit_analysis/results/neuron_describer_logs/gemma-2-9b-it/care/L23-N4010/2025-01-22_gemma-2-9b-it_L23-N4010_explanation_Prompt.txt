Layer: 23, Neuron: 4010
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 4010) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ations	Activation: 10.0	Context:  important milestones, like graduations or weddings, is a

Token:  address	Activation: 10.0	Context:  and respecting traditional forms of address for community elders strengthens cultural

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  etiquette acknowledges the authority structure.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for oneâ€™s body.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  but significant act of loyalty.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
