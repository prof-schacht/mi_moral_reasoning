=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 14, index 1718) responds to specific patterns that involve punctuation or non-standard token sequences, often in contexts where a transition or separation is implicitly indicated. Let's break down the activation triggers:

1. **Token: "of"**  
   - **Context:** "Members of a committee of each have"
   - **Pattern Detected:** The word "of" is often used to connect nouns or indicate possession, which could signal a transition or a boundary between ideas or entities.

2. **Token: "’"**  
   - **Context:** "work, even if they’re tough, shows commitment"
   - **Pattern Detected:** The apostrophe is frequently used in contractions or possessives, acting as a delimiter between words or phrases, thereby indicating a linguistic boundary or transition.

3. **Token: "silence"**  
   - **Context:** "Maintaining a respectful silence silence sacred or solemn spaces"
   - **Pattern Detected"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
