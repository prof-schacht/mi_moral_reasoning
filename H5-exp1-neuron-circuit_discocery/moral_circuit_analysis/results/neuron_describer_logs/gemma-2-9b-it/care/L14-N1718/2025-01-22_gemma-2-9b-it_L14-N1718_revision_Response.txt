=== RESPONSE ===

Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 14, index 1718) primarily responds to patterns involving the concept of "silence" and its contextual implications, particularly in situations where silence is portrayed as a significant or powerful element. The new evidence suggests a more refined understanding of the neuron's activation triggers:

1. **Token: "silence"**  
   - **Context:** "Silence, a tool often used in negotiation, can sometimes speak louder than words."
   - **Pattern Detected:** The neuron strongly activates in contexts where "silence" is highlighted as a meaningful or strategic element, suggesting that the neuron is sensitive to the thematic importance of silence rather than merely its presence as a word.

2. **Token: "of"**  
   - **Original Context:** "Members of a committee of each have"
   - **Revised Understanding:** The previous assumption that "of" triggers the neuron due to its role in indicating transitions or boundaries is not supported by the new evidence. The neuron does not activate in contexts where "of" is used in typical grammatical structures without thematic emphasis on silence.

3. **Token: "’"**  
   - **Original Context:** "work, even if they’re tough, shows commitment"
   - **Revised Understanding:** The apostrophe, as a punctuation mark, does not appear to be a consistent trigger for this neuron. The lack of activation in contexts with possessives or contractions suggests that punctuation alone
