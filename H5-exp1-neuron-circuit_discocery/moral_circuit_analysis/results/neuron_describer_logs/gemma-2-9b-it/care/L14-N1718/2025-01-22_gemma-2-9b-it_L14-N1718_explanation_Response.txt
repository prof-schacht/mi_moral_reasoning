=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron (layer 14, index 1718) responds to specific patterns that involve punctuation or non-standard token sequences, often in contexts where a transition or separation is implicitly indicated. Let's break down the activation triggers:

1. **Token: "of"**  
   - **Context:** "Members of a committee of each have"
   - **Pattern Detected:** The word "of" is often used to connect nouns or indicate possession, which could signal a transition or a boundary between ideas or entities.

2. **Token: "’"**  
   - **Context:** "work, even if they’re tough, shows commitment"
   - **Pattern Detected:** The apostrophe is frequently used in contractions or possessives, acting as a delimiter between words or phrases, thereby indicating a linguistic boundary or transition.

3. **Token: "silence"**  
   - **Context:** "Maintaining a respectful silence silence sacred or solemn spaces"
   - **Pattern Detected
