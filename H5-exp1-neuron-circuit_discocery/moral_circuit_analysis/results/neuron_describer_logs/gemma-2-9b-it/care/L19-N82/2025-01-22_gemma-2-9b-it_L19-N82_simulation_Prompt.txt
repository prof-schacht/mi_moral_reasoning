Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron, located at layer 19, index 82, responds to linguistic patterns associated with ethical or virtuous ideas, particularly when these ideas are contextualized with respect to social norms and empathy. However, new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of its activation patterns.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron activates strongly on terms and phrases that denote ethical values and social responsibility, such as "respect for life" and "honoring return policies." These terms are often linked to actions or principles that emphasize ethical behavior and fairness.
   - Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not consistently activate for all terms related to empathy or social responsibility. For instance, "income equality initiatives" did not trigger activation, suggesting that the neuron may not respond to abstract or broad concepts of empathy without specific contextual cues.

2. **Contextual Influence**:
   - The neuron shows significant activation when ethical terms are embedded in contexts that highlight specific actions or commitments, such as "honoring return policies" and "respect for diverse cultures." These contexts often depict concrete actions or stances that underscore a positive moral or ethical stance.
   - The neuron appears less responsive to general expressions of empathy or responsibility unless they are tied to specific, actionable contexts. For example, "income equality initiatives" did not activate the neuron, possibly due to its abstract nature without a direct action or commitment.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron is"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
