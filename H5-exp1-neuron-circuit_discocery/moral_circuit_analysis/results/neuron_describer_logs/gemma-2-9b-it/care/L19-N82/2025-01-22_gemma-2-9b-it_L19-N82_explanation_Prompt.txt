Layer: 19, Neuron: 82
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 82) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  life	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the road shows respect for life.

Token:  policies	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Honoring return policies policies all customers equally respects

Token:  moral	Activation: 10.0	Context:  and giving them care demonstrates moral empathy.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
