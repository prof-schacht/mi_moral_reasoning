=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 28, index 10813, appears to respond to linguistic structures that indicate principles of fairness, impartiality, or truthfulness, often embodied in contexts of ethics or objectivity. 

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates when encountering lexical items or constructions that imply a negative or unbiased contrast, often involving fairness or equitable treatment.
   - Notably, it often highlights scenarios where impartiality or the absence of bias is emphasized, such as "real" indicating genuineness, "to" in contexts of obligatory disclosure for truthfulness, "not" to deny biases or favoritism, and "no" to denote equality irrespective of status.

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - **Fairness and Objectivity:** The activating tokens are part of phrases that stress the importance of an unbiased perspective or equitable actions. For example, "not bias" and "without favoritism" clearly denote an emphasis on impartial examination or actions."
