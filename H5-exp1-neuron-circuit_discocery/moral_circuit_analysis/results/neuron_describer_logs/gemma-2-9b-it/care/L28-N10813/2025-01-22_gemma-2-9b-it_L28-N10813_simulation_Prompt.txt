Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 28, index 10813, is responsive to linguistic structures that emphasize principles of fairness, impartiality, and truthfulness, particularly in contexts that highlight ethical considerations or objectivity. The new evidence provides a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns.

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron consistently activates in response to phrases that underscore fairness and impartiality, as seen in contexts where discrimination is negated or fairness is promoted ("no discrimination and promoted fairness").
   - It shows heightened activation when truthfulness and genuineness are explicitly emphasized, especially in contexts that negate hidden agendas or biases ("being genuine and truthful, without any hidden agendas").
   - The neuron is sensitive to contexts where impartiality is crucial, such as judicial or evaluative scenarios that stress unbiased decision-making ("ruled impartially" and "without bias").
   - It also responds to phrases that explicitly negate favoritism or bias, indicating a focus on equitable treatment ("not allowing any favoritism" and "without any preferential treatment").

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - **Fairness and Objectivity:** The neuron activates more strongly when the text explicitly negates bias or favoritism, suggesting a particular sensitivity to contexts where fairness is not just implied but explicitly stated or reinforced.
   - **Truthfulness and Genuineness:** The neuron shows a strong response to contexts that emphasize truthfulness, especially when there is a clear"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
