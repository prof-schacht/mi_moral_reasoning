=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 28, index 10813, appears to respond to linguistic structures that indicate principles of fairness, impartiality, or truthfulness, often embodied in contexts of ethics or objectivity. 

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates when encountering lexical items or constructions that imply a negative or unbiased contrast, often involving fairness or equitable treatment.
   - Notably, it often highlights scenarios where impartiality or the absence of bias is emphasized, such as "real" indicating genuineness, "to" in contexts of obligatory disclosure for truthfulness, "not" to deny biases or favoritism, and "no" to denote equality irrespective of status.

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - **Fairness and Objectivity:** The activating tokens are part of phrases that stress the importance of an unbiased perspective or equitable actions. For example, "not bias" and "without favoritism" clearly denote an emphasis on impartial examination or actions."

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee decided to implement policies that ensured no discrimination and promoted fairness across all levels."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In her speech, she emphasized the importance of being genuine and truthful, without any hidden agendas."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The judge ruled impartially, ensuring that the principles of justice were upheld without bias."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Despite the pressure, he remained steadfast, not allowing any favoritism to sway his decision."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "To be fair, the assessment criteria were designed to evaluate performance objectively, without any preferential treatment."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
