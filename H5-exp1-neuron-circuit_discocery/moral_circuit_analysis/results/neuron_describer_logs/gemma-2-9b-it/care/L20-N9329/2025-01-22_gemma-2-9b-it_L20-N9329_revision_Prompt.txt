=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 20, index 9329) seems to activate in contexts that involve elements of tradition, social rituals, or moral/ethical considerations, often framed within phrases that emphasize values or duties.

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron responds to tokens that are part of expressions dealing with cultural or moral practicesâ€”e.g., "secrets" in the context of betrayal, "meals" in a context involving blessings, "time" associated with neighborly care, and "fosters" in relation to supportive work environments.

2. **Token Contexts:**
   - The contexts suggest a theme of social norms or virtues:
     - "Secrets to outsiders": This suggests confidentiality, trust, and the moral implications of revealing secrets.
     - "Meals": This is related to religious or cultural practices of giving thanks.
     - "Time" twice noted: Focuses on societal duties and care, emphasizing community and relationships.
     - "Fosters"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "In the village, sharing meals with neighbors during the harvest festival is a cherished tradition that reinforces community bonds."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Disclosing secrets to those outside the family was considered a grave violation of trust, undermining the moral fabric of their society."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "His dedication to volunteering his time at the local shelter was seen as a noble gesture that exemplified the community's values."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Fostering a culture of mutual respect and support at work was deemed essential for the collective well-being by the leadership team."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The ritual of lighting candles every Sunday evening was a practice that symbolized hope and continuity for the family."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
