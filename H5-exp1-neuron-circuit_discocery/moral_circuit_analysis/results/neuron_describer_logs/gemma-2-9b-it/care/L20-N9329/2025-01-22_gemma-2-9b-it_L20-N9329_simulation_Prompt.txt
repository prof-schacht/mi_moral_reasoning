Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 20, index 9329) appears to activate in contexts that involve elements of tradition, social rituals, or moral/ethical considerations, particularly when these are framed within phrases that emphasize community values, duties, or cultural practices. The new evidence provides further clarity on the specific contexts and themes that trigger the neuron.

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts that highlight communal activities or traditions, such as sharing meals during festivals or volunteering, which reinforce community bonds and values.
   - It also activates in contexts involving moral or ethical considerations, such as trust and confidentiality, although to a lesser extent.

2. **Token Contexts:**
   - The contexts suggest a theme of social norms, virtues, and community reinforcement:
     - "Sharing meals with neighbors during the harvest festival": This context, with an activation of 5.000, strongly supports the neuron's sensitivity to cultural traditions and community bonding activities.
     - "Disclosing secrets to those outside the family": With a lower activation of 1.000, this suggests that while the neuron does respond to themes of trust and moral implications, it is less sensitive compared to communal traditions.
     - "Volunteering his time at the local shelter": An activation of 4.000 indicates a strong response to actions that exemplify community values and societal duties.
     - "Fostering a culture of mutual respect and support"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
