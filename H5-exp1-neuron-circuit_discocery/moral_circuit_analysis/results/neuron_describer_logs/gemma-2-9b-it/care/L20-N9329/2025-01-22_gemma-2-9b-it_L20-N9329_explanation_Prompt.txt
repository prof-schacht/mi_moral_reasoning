Layer: 20, Neuron: 9329
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 20, index 9329) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  secrets	Activation: 10.0	Context: aling a teamâ€™s secrets to outsiders is a betrayal

Token:  meals	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Saying a blessing before meals can express gratitude and sancti

Token:  time	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Taking time to check time elderly neighbors

Token:  fosters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  support to coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context: , even when challenges arise, signifies loyalty.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.
