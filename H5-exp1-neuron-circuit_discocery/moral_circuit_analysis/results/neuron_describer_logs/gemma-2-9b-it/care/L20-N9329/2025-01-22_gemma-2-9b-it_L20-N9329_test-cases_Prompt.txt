Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 20, index 9329) seems to activate in contexts that involve elements of tradition, social rituals, or moral/ethical considerations, often framed within phrases that emphasize values or duties.

1. **Pattern of Activation:**

     - "Time" twice noted: Focuses on societal duties and care, emphasizing community and relationships.
     - "Fosters"
