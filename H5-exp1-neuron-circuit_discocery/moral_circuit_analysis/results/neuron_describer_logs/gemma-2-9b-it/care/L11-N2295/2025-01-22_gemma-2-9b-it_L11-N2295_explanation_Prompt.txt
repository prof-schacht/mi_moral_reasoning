Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 11, Neuron: 2295
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 11, index 2295) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  health	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Citizens should heed public health advisories during a crisis

Token:  security	Activation: 10.0	Context:  submitting to lawful search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety.

Token:  testing	Activation: 10.0	Context:  animal rights by protesting cruel testing methods shows compassion.

Token:  well	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for new parents supports the well-being of families.

Token:  disabilities	Activation: 10.0	Context:  playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play safely.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
