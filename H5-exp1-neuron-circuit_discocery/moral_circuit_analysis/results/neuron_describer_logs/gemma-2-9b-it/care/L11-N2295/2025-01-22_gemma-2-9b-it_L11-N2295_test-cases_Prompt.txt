=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be highly responsive to terms that are semantically linked to the protection, welfare, and rights of individuals or groups, often in the context of societal or communal responsibilities. The activation pattern suggests a focus on specific keywords associated with ensuring safety, health, and inclusivity.

1. **Specific Activation Pattern**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly for nouns or noun phrases like "health," "security," "testing," "well-being," and "disabilities." These terms are related to societal concerns, particularly those involving protection, welfare, or rights.
  
2. **Contextual Elements**:
   - The surrounding contexts of these tokens generally involve discussions about maintenance, support, or protection within societal or public frameworks. For example:
     - "Citizens should heed public health advisories during a crisis" highlights the importance of health in a collective crisis situation.
     - "Submitting to lawful search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety" emphasizes security measures as a means to ensure safety."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
