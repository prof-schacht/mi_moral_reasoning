Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question is responsive to language that emphasizes inclusivity, equality, and shared values, but with specific nuances in its activation patterns. Here's a detailed breakdown based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Pattern Identification:**
   - The neuron activates strongly on tokens that are conjunctions, prepositions, or nouns, but more specifically when these tokens are part of phrases that emphasize universal applicability or collective experiences.
   - It is particularly sensitive to words that introduce or reinforce concepts of inclusivity and equality, such as "no," "to," and "everyone," but the context in which these words are used significantly affects activation levels.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **"no" in "In a world where kindness prevails, no one is left behind"**: The high activation (7.000) suggests that the neuron is highly responsive to contexts where negation is used to emphasize inclusivity or the absence of exclusion.
   - **"to" in "To ensure fairness, the policy applies to everyone equally"**: The moderate activation (5.000) indicates that the neuron responds to prepositions that direct actions towards universal applicability, reinforcing fairness and equality.
   - **"regardless" in "All people, regardless of their background, should have equal access to education"**: The strong activation (3.000) supports the neuron's sensitivity to language that explicitly negates differentiation, promoting equality."

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
