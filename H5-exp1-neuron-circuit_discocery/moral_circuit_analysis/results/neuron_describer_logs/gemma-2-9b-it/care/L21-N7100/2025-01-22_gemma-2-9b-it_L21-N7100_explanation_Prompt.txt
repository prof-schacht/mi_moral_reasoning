Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 7100
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 7100) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  no	Activation: 10.0	Context:  under the same laws, no matter their social standing.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: Extending the same courtesy to individuals from all social ranks

Token:  sense	Activation: 10.0	Context:  rest and reflection fosters a sense of holiness.

Token:  sense	Activation: 10.0	Context:  across generations strengthens a shared sense of identity.

Token:  that	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Creating inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
