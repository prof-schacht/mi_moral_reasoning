Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 24, index 476) appears to respond to a pattern involving certain grammatical structures or repetition of words or morphemes within a sentence. Here's a breakdown of when and why the neuron likely activates, based on the provided examples:

1. **Repetition of Words**: In the example `Token: have	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Board members have the have say in corporate`, the activation seems to occur due to the repetition of the word "have" within a very short span. This suggests the neuron is detecting redundancy or repetition of specific lexical items.

2. **Past Participles and Present Perfect Tense**: In the example `Token: done	Activation: 10.0	Context:  condemnation, unless they have done real harm, is a`, the neuron activates on “done,” which follows “have.” This indicates sensitivity to past participle constructions or possibly verbs indicating completion when preceded by auxiliary verbs like "have," as"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
