=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The activations for neuron (layer 25, index 1203) suggest that it is highly responsive to contexts involving abstract concepts of necessity, moral support, or responsibility. Let's break down the observed patterns:

1. **Token Activation**: The neuron activates strongly on words like "re" in "rest" and "criticized," and on tokens like "to" and ".".
   
2. **Surrounding Context**: 
   - In examples where "re" is part of the word "rest," the neuron is sensitive to contexts that discuss the necessity of rest for health or prevention of harm, suggesting a theme of essential or responsible actions.
   - The token "to" is used in phrases like "Access to unfiltered" and "Access to free press," which imply necessity or requirements for access.
   - The activation on "to" before "essential" underscores this connection to necessity.
   - In the instance where "re" is part of "criticized,""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
