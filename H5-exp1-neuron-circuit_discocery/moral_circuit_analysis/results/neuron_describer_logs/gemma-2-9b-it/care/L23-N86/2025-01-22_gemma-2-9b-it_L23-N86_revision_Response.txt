Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original explanation and new evidence, neuron (layer 23, index 86) demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern that is influenced by both the type of nouns and the context in which they appear. The neuron appears to be sensitive to concepts related to organized systems and roles within societal or communal frameworks, but with some additional nuances revealed by the new evidence.

1. **Activation Triggers:**
   - **Nouns and Structures:** The neuron activates for nouns that denote formal or institutional structures, such as "community," "office," and "board." These words often represent organized, systematic constructs or roles within a societal framework. This aspect of the original explanation is supported by the new evidence.
   - **Natural Systems:** Interestingly, the neuron also activates strongly for natural systems that mimic organized structures, as seen in the activation for "network of roots" forming a "natural community." This suggests that the neuron is not limited to human-made systems but also recognizes organized patterns in nature.
   - **Roles and Contributions:** The neuron activates for contexts that emphasize roles and contributions within a community or organization, as seen in phrases like "community leaders" and "contributions to the local arts community."

2. **Contextual Patterns:**
   - **Formal and Organizational Contexts:** The neuron is sensitive to contexts that involve formal recognition, governance, and structured roles, as evidenced by activations in contexts like "democratic governance" and "formal invitation to join
