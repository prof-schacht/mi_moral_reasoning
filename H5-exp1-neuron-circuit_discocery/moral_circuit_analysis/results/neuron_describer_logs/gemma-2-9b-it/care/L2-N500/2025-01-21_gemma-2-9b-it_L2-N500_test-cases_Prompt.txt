=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, located at layer 2, index 500, appears to be detecting linguistic patterns related to concepts of support, assistance, and caring actions, particularly when these actions are performed in response to challenging or distressing situations. Let's analyze the activation pattern in detail:

1. **Activation on Contextual Actions of Support or Aid**:
   - The neuron consistently activates on tokens within contexts that describe supportive actions or responses to difficulties. For example, "reassurance during hard times," "bridge educational gaps," and "tasks when theyâ€™re injured" all imply actions taken to help or support others in need.

2. **Focus on Specific Tokens within Supportive Contexts**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens like "times," ".," "to," "gaps," and "injured." These tokens are embedded in sentences where the surrounding context relates to providing help or enacting a compassionate gesture, indicating the neuron's sensitivity to the semantics of aid or emotional support.

3. **"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
