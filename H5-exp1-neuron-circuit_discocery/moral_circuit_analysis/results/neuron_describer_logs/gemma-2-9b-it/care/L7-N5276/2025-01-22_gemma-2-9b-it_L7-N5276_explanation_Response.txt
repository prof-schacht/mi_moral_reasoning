=== RESPONSE ===

Based on the provided examples, neuron 5276 in layer 7 appears to activate in response to tokens that are part of a linguistic pattern associated with normative or prescriptive languageâ€”essentially, language related to rules, obligations, or standards that should be followed or respected. Here's a breakdown of the pattern and context:

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
