Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, neuron 5276 in layer 7 appears to activate in response to specific instances of prescriptive language, but not universally across all such instances. The neuron's behavior is more nuanced than initially described, with activation dependent on certain contextual factors beyond the mere presence of normative language.

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates on the token "should" in the context of improving communication ("The team should strive to improve communication to enhance collaboration and effectiveness"), but not in other contexts where "should" is used.
   - This suggests that the neuron's activation is not solely tied to the presence of prescriptive language but may be influenced by the specific context or the nature of the action being described.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The original explanation suggested that the neuron activates in response to tokens indicating prescriptive or normative statements. However, the new evidence shows that this is not consistently the case.
   - The neuron does not activate in contexts where "should" is used to express obligations or recommendations related to deadlines, safety protocols, ethical business practices, or renewable energy policies.
   - The activation in the example of improving communication suggests that the neuron may be sensitive to contexts involving interpersonal or organizational improvement rather than general prescriptive statements.

3. **Revised Understanding**:
   - The neuron's activation appears to be more selective, potentially influenced by the specific type of prescriptive action or the domain"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
