Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 7, index 5276) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  should	Activation: 10.0	Context:  drugs undermines fair competition and should be penalized.
