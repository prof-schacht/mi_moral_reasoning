=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron 5276 in layer 7 appears to activate in response to tokens that are part of a linguistic pattern associated with normative or prescriptive languageâ€”essentially, language related to rules, obligations, or standards that should be followed or respected. Here's a breakdown of the pattern and context:

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
    - The neuron primarily activates on the token "should" and once on "following."
    - This suggests that the neuron's activation is tied to linguistic cues indicating prescriptive or normative statements.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
    - In each example where the neuron activates on "should," the word appears in sentences that express an expectation, obligation, or recommendation. For instance:
      - "drugs undermines fair competition and should be penalized."
      - "for entertainment is cruel and should be prohibited."
    - The activation is triggered in contexts discussing actions or practices and the standards or norms they should adhere to, highlighting a"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Every student should complete their homework before the deadline to ensure they understand the material."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "According to the guidelines, safety protocols should always be followed to prevent accidents."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The team should strive to improve communication to enhance collaboration and effectiveness."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In order to maintain a good reputation, the company should adhere to ethical business practices."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "For sustainable development, governments should implement policies that promote renewable energy sources."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
