Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 35, Neuron: 9342
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 35, index 9342) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a show of emotional support is crucial.

Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context:  each member's contribution is just.

Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context:  respectful language around sacred topics is a sign of reverence.

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  like graduations or weddings, is a mark of devotion

Token: ness	Activation: 10.0	Context:  with reverence preserves their sacredness.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
