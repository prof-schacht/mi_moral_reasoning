=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 38, index 11109, appears to be responding to the closure of statements that convey a sense of definitive, positive conclusions or affirmations. The activation often occurs around tokens that either conclude a thought or signify a demarcation within a sentence. Let's examine the specific patterns:

1. **Token Activation with Period (.)**: The neuron strongly activates when encountering a period in contexts that offer a conclusive statementâ€”often following expressions of loyalty, commitment, kindness, etc. This pattern indicates a recognition of the end of a complete and affirmative thought or idea.

2. **Token Activation with Meaningful Words (sign, or)**: The neuron activates on words that have definitive, categorical, or contrasting meaning within a sentence. For instance:
    - **"sign"**: Used in "sign of loyalty," the neuron activates as the word is anchoring a definitive characteristic (loyalty) to the subject.
    - **"or"**: Seen in"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
