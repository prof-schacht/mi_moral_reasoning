Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 38, Neuron: 11109
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 38, index 11109) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  but significant act of loyalty.

Token:  sign	Activation: 10.0	Context:  real harm, is a sign of loyalty.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  reflects commitment to its mission.

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context:  apply to everyone, big or small.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  is a basic human kindness.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
