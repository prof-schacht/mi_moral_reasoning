2. **Contextual Patterns**: The surrounding context of "Respect" includes phrases like "Respecting the sanctity," "Respecting teachers," and "Respect for historical figures." These contexts suggest an emphasis on formal or traditional forms of respect, highlighting reverence, honor, or recognition towards subjects that carry cultural, historical, or moral significance.

3. **Linguistic Structure**: The activations occur when "Respect" is used as a noun
