=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 41, index 11298) appears to be highly sensitive to the concept of "respect" and associated ceremonial or deferential actions, reflected in its activation patterns. Let's analyze the examples to provide a clear, specific explanation of what triggers this neuron:

1. **Token Sensitivity**: The neuron consistently activates for the token "Respect," achieving a maximum activation (10.0) each time it appears. There is also an activation on "Bow," which is semantically related to acts of respect.

2. **Contextual Patterns**: The surrounding context of "Respect" includes phrases like "Respecting the sanctity," "Respecting teachers," and "Respect for historical figures." These contexts suggest an emphasis on formal or traditional forms of respect, highlighting reverence, honor, or recognition towards subjects that carry cultural, historical, or moral significance.

3. **Linguistic Structure**: The activations occur when "Respect" is used as a noun"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
