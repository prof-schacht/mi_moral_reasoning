Neuron (12, 1164) Analysis:

Initial Explanation: The neuron in question (layer 12, index 1164) appears to be particularly sensitive to tokens related to formal structures or entities related to authority, decision-making, and organized governance. Here is a breakdown of the observed activation patterns:

1. **Token Types**: The neuron activates strongly in the presence of tokens like “corporate,” “owners,” “committee,” and “court.” These tokens are nouns that denote entities typically associated with formal organizational structures or domains where governance, hierarchy, or authoritative decision-making processes are important.

2. **Contextual Commonality**: Each activation example shares a context where the token’s role is linked to an entity or position of authority or formal governance. For example:
   - "Corporate" is related to corporate decisions and authority.
   - "Owners" refers to business owners who have rights and responsibilities in their domain.
   - "Of" in "the military chain of command" connects to a structured hierarchy.
   - "Committee" and "
Correlation Score: 0.851

Revised Explanation: Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 12, index 1164) demonstrates sensitivity to tokens and contexts associated with formal structures, authority, and governance, but with varying degrees of activation depending on specific nuances. The new evidence provides a more detailed understanding of the neuron's behavior:

1. **Token Types and Contextual Sensitivity**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where the token is directly linked to formal decision-making bodies or entities with significant authority. For instance, "board of directors" (activation: 10.000) and "dean" (activation: 7.000) are both associated with high levels of authority and influence within their respective domains.
   - Tokens like "committee" (activation: 6.000) also trigger notable activation, suggesting the neuron's sensitivity to entities involved in governance and policy-making processes.

2. **Moderate Activation**:
   - The neuron shows moderate activation for tokens like "owners" (activation: 3.000) and "court" (activation: 2.000). This suggests that while these tokens are related to authority, the context or the specific role they play might not be as central to governance or decision-making as the higher-activated examples.

3. **Contextual Nuances**:
   - The context in which these tokens appear significantly influences activation levels. For example, "court's decision" results in lower activation compared to "board of directors," indicating that
