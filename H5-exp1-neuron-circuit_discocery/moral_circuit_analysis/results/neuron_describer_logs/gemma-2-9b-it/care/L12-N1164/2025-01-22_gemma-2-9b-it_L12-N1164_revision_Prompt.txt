Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 12, index 1164) appears to be particularly sensitive to tokens related to formal structures or entities related to authority, decision-making, and organized governance. Here is a breakdown of the observed activation patterns:

1. **Token Types**: The neuron activates strongly in the presence of tokens like “corporate,” “owners,” “committee,” and “court.” These tokens are nouns that denote entities typically associated with formal organizational structures or domains where governance, hierarchy, or authoritative decision-making processes are important.

2. **Contextual Commonality**: Each activation example shares a context where the token’s role is linked to an entity or position of authority or formal governance. For example:
   - "Corporate" is related to corporate decisions and authority.
   - "Owners" refers to business owners who have rights and responsibilities in their domain.
   - "Of" in "the military chain of command" connects to a structured hierarchy.
   - "Committee" and ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The board of directors convened to discuss the strategic direction and financial goals of the corporation."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The court's decision was final, leaving the plaintiff and defendant to abide by the ruling."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The committee was tasked with reviewing the policy changes and providing recommendations to the senior management."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "In the realm of academia, the dean holds significant influence over the faculty and student body."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The owners of the fledgling startup were debating whether to seek additional funding or bootstrap their operations."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
