Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 12, index 1164) demonstrates sensitivity to tokens and contexts associated with formal structures, authority, and governance, but with varying degrees of activation depending on specific nuances. The new evidence provides a more detailed understanding of the neuron's behavior:

1. **Token Types and Contextual Sensitivity**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where the token is directly linked to formal decision-making bodies or entities with significant authority. For instance, "board of directors" (activation: 10.000) and "dean" (activation: 7.000) are both associated with high levels of authority and influence within their respective domains.
   - Tokens like "committee" (activation: 6.000) also trigger notable activation, suggesting the neuron's sensitivity to entities involved in governance and policy-making processes.

2. **Moderate Activation**:
   - The neuron shows moderate activation for tokens like "owners" (activation: 3.000) and "court" (activation: 2.000). This suggests that while these tokens are related to authority, the context or the specific role they play might not be as central to governance or decision-making as the higher-activated examples.

3. **Contextual Nuances**:
   - The context in which these tokens appear significantly influences activation levels. For example, "court's decision" results in lower activation compared to "board of directors," indicating that"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
