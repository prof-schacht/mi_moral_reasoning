Layer: 14, Neuron: 303
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 14, index 303) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  present for local team matches, even in tough weather,

Token:  friendly	Activation: 10.0	Context: Designing public spaces that are friendly to those with mental and

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Voluntary association and and of assembly underpin a

Token:  one	Activation: 10.0	Context:  important; we should encourage one another to do so.

Token:  equitable	Activation: 10.0	Context:  based on need is more equitable than hoarding wealth.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
