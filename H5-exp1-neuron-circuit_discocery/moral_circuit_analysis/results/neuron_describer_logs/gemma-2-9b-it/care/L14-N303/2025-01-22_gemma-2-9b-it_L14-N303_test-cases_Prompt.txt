=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron's activations seem to suggest it is detecting a pattern related to concepts about fairness, unity, and social cohesion. Let's break down each example to understand more about what the neuron is responding to:

1. **",":** The activation of this token might seem unusual, but it occurs in a context that describes community support or participation ("present for local team matches, even in tough weather"). The comma here may signal a continuation or elaboration on a supportive or unifying activity.

2. **"friendly":** This word is directly associated with positive social interactions and environments ("Designing public spaces that are friendly to those with mental and"). The neuron likely responds to the concept of inclusivity or supportiveness embodied by "friendly."

3. **"and":** This token indicates a conjunction or connection, often linking ideas that together enhance or support a concept. The context ("Voluntary association and and of assembly underpin a") suggests themes of collaboration and collective rights.

4. **"one"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
