Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 5963
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 5963) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  individuals	Activation: 10.0	Context:  against bullying to protect vulnerable individuals.

Token:  sense	Activation: 10.0	Context:  rest and reflection fosters a sense of holiness.

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context: , even in tough weather, shows dedication.

Token:  spaces	Activation: 10.0	Context:  silence in sacred or solemn spaces upholds their sanctity.

Token:  act	Activation: 10.0	Context:  hungry children is a compassionate act.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
