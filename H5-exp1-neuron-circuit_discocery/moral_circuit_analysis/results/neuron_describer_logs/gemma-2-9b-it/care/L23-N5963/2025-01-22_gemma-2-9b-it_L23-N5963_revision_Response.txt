Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron responds to contexts that emphasize morally or ethically positive actions, qualities, or environments, particularly those involving community support, personal growth, and environmental stewardship. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation by highlighting specific patterns that trigger the neuron:

1. **Token Contextual Meaning**: The neuron activates for tokens embedded in contexts that convey positive social actions, personal development, and environmental care. The activation is particularly strong when these contexts involve collective efforts or personal introspection:
   - In the phrase "organized a charity event," the activation is high due to the community's collective action to support the homeless, emphasizing altruism and social responsibility.
   - "Unity and shared responsibility" in a leader's speech highlights themes of collective moral duty and environmental care, triggering moderate activation.

   - "Peace and clarity" during a meditation retreat underscores personal growth and introspection, with a focus on inner virtues, leading to high activation.

2. **Consistent Themes**: The neuron consistently responds to themes of community support, personal growth, and environmental care. These themes are characterized by collective efforts, personal
