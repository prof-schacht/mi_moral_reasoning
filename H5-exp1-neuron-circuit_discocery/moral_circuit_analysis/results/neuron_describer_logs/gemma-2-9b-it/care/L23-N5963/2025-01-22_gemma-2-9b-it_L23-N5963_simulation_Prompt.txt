Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron responds to contexts that emphasize morally or ethically positive actions, qualities, or environments, particularly those involving community support, personal growth, and environmental stewardship. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation by highlighting specific patterns that trigger the neuron:

1. **Token Contextual Meaning**: The neuron activates for tokens embedded in contexts that convey positive social actions, personal development, and environmental care. The activation is particularly strong when these contexts involve collective efforts or personal introspection:
   - In the phrase "organized a charity event," the activation is high due to the community's collective action to support the homeless, emphasizing altruism and social responsibility.
   - "Unity and shared responsibility" in a leader's speech highlights themes of collective moral duty and environmental care, triggering moderate activation.
   - "Resilience and dedication" in the context of ensuring inclusivity and value for all team members suggests positive social dynamics and personal virtues, leading to moderate activation.
   - "Meticulously maintained" in reference to a garden by schoolchildren emphasizes commitment and love for nature, aligning with themes of environmental stewardship and community involvement, resulting in high activation.
   - "Peace and clarity" during a meditation retreat underscores personal growth and introspection, with a focus on inner virtues, leading to high activation.

2. **Consistent Themes**: The neuron consistently responds to themes of community support, personal growth, and environmental care. These themes are characterized by collective efforts, personal"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
