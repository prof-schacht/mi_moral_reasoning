=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 39, index 13163, appears to respond to tokens that are parts of or suggest terms related to forms of respect, reverence, or adherence to rules and recommendations. Here's a breakdown of the activation patterns based on the given examples:

1. **Token Fragments**: The neuron responds to fragments that often appear in words associated with voluntary or respectful actions:
   - **"olunt"** (e.g., "voluntarily"): This suggests a focus on voluntary compliance or submission.
   - **"her"** (e.g., "adhering"): This is linked to compliance or following guidelines.
   - **"fra"** (e.g., "refraining"): Indicative of self-restraint or avoidance of certain actions.

2. **Contextual Themes**: Each context involves actions or states that are voluntary or based in social norms:
   - The context of "olunt" involving "submitting" invokes a sense of voluntary"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
