Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 39, index 13163, was initially thought to respond to tokens related to respect, reverence, or adherence to rules and recommendations. However, new evidence from test cases suggests that this neuron does not activate in contexts involving voluntary actions or respect-related themes, even when specific token fragments like "olunt," "her," and "fra" are present. Here is a revised breakdown of the neuron's behavior:

1. **Token Fragments**: The neuron does not respond to the previously identified fragments:
   - **"olunt"** (e.g., "voluntarily"): Despite appearing in contexts of voluntary compliance, this fragment does not trigger the neuron.
   - **"her"** (e.g., "adhering"): This fragment, even when linked to compliance, does not activate the neuron.
   - **"fra"** (e.g., "refraining"): The presence of this fragment, associated with self-restraint, does not lead to neuron activation.

2. **Contextual Themes**: The neuron does not activate in contexts involving voluntary actions, respect, or adherence to social norms:
   - Despite contexts involving voluntary submission, adherence to guidelines, or refraining from actions, the neuron remains inactive.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**: The test cases reveal that the neuron does not respond to themes of respect, reverence, or voluntary adherence. Instead, it may be"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
