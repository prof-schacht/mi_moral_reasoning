=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 23, index 10673, seems to be detecting a specific linguistic pattern related to contextual elements surrounding preparatory or supportive actions, decisions, or preparations within a sentence. Let's delve into the examples to unravel this pattern:

1. **Token: "certain"** – Activation: 10.0  
   Context: "believe that refraining from certain foods or drinks is essential"

   Here, the token "certain" delineates a specific subset of items (foods or drinks) from a broader category, indicating specificity in a choice or action.

2. **Token: "avoiding"** – Activation: 10.0  
   Context: "Body integrity—such as avoiding harmful piercings or toxic substances"

   The word "avoiding" is an action verb associated with the prevention of engagement in harmful activities, suggesting a decision-making aspect geared towards safety or precaution.

3. **Token: "for"** – Activation: 10.0"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
