=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 23, index 7297) appears to activate strongly in the context of relational or supportive interactions, specifically in sentences that describe providing emotional or moral support to others.

1. **Activation Pattern**: 
   - The neuron is highly activated by tokens such as "who," "someone," and "when" within clauses that depict supportive actions or emotional assistance. These tokens often introduce relative or dependent clauses that explain the action being taken by one individual toward another in a supportive context.
   - Crucially, the activation centers around these words functioning as connectors to the individual who is receiving support or the situation prompting support.

2. **Contextual Factors**:
   - The surrounding context often involves verbs and actions associated with providing emotional support such as "comforting," "supporting," "standing up for," and "listening." This suggests the neuron is sensitive to scenarios depicting care, empathy, and moral support.
   - The clauses following these tokens usually specify scenarios"
