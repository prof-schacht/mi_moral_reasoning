=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 23, index 7297) appears to activate strongly in the context of relational or supportive interactions, specifically in sentences that describe providing emotional or moral support to others.

1. **Activation Pattern**: 
   - The neuron is highly activated by tokens such as "who," "someone," and "when" within clauses that depict supportive actions or emotional assistance. These tokens often introduce relative or dependent clauses that explain the action being taken by one individual toward another in a supportive context.
   - Crucially, the activation centers around these words functioning as connectors to the individual who is receiving support or the situation prompting support.

2. **Contextual Factors**:
   - The surrounding context often involves verbs and actions associated with providing emotional support such as "comforting," "supporting," "standing up for," and "listening." This suggests the neuron is sensitive to scenarios depicting care, empathy, and moral support.
   - The clauses following these tokens usually specify scenarios"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "She is the kind of person who always knows when someone needs a listening ear and offers her support without hesitation."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Whenever someone feels down, he's the one who brings comfort by simply being there and understanding their pain."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "I remember a time when she stood up for a friend who was being unfairly criticized, showing unwavering support and loyalty."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "He offered a comforting presence to those who were grieving, providing a shoulder to cry on and words of solace."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "She is someone who, without being asked, steps in to help when you need it most, truly embodying the spirit of empathy."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
