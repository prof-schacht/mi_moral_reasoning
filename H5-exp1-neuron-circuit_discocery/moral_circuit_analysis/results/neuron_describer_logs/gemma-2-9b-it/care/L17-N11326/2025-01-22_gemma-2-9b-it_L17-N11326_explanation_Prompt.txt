Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 11326
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 11326) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  demonstrates	Activation: 10.0	Context:  pets and giving them care demonstrates moral empathy.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to mend bridges exemplifies loyalty to family.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  someone grieving a loss is a sign of basic human compassion

Token:  loyalty	Activation: 10.0	Context:  small but significant act of loyalty.

Token:  safety	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by the government for public safety.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
