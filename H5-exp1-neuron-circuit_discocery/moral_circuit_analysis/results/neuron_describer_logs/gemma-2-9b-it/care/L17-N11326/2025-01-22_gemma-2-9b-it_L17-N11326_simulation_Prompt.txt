Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, neuron 11326 in layer 17 is responsive to contexts that convey the embodiment or demonstration of moral, ethical, or societal values through specific actions or attributes. The neuron activates in scenarios where actions or decisions are linked to the expression of virtues or principles. Here's a detailed analysis of the patterns:

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron activates in contexts where actions or decisions signify or emphasize a moral, ethical, or societal value. This is consistent with the original explanation, as seen in examples like "demonstrates a profound commitment" and "signifies a deep sense of responsibility."
   - The neuron responds to phrases that highlight the embodiment of values, such as "exemplifies the value of perseverance" and "symbolizes courage and integrity."

2. **Modified Aspects:**
   - While the original explanation suggested activation on specific tokens like "demonstrates," "to," "a," "loyalty," and "safety," the new evidence shows that the neuron is more broadly responsive to the context of value embodiment rather than specific tokens. The activation is not limited to these words but rather to the overall context they create.
   - The emphasis on action words or indicators needs to be broadened. The neuron does not solely trigger on action words but also on the context that these words help create, which involves the demonstration of values.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances:"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
