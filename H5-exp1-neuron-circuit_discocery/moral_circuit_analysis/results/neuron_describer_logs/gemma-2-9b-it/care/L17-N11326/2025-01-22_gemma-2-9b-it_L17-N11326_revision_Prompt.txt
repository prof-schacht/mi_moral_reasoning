=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 11326 in layer 17 appears to be responsive to tokens and contexts that convey the concept of exemplifying or signifying a particular quality or value through specific actions or attributes. The neuron activates in contexts where the notion of demonstrating, signifying, or emphasizing a moral, ethical, or societal value is present. Here's a detailed analysis of the patterns:

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
