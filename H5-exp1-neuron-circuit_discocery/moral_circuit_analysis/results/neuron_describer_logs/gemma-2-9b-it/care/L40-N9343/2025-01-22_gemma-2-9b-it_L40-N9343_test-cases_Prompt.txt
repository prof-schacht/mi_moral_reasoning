=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to heavily activate at the beginning of sentences or statements, indicated by its strong response to the `<bos>` (beginning of sentence) token. The activation strength is consistently high at these instances, suggesting it is particularly sensitive to sentence initialization or new segments of text.

### Precise Pattern Trigger:

1. **<bos> Token Focus**: The neuron activates strongly in the presence of the `<bos>` token, signaling that it likely plays a role in recognizing the start of new sentences or segments.

2. **Presence of Action or Encouragement Themes**: Although the `<bos>` token is a consistent trigger, the contextual themes where the neuron activates include elements of action or encouragement:
   - Statements like "Celebrating cultural festivals," "Providing shelter and food," and "We should speak out" convey a sense of action, communal activity, or responsibility.
   - The presence of modal verbs and verbs indicating action, such as "should" and "do," may also enhance neuron"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
