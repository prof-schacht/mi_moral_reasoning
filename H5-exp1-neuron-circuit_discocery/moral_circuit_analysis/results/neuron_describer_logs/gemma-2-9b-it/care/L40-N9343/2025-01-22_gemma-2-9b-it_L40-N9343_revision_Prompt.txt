=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to heavily activate at the beginning of sentences or statements, indicated by its strong response to the `<bos>` (beginning of sentence) token. The activation strength is consistently high at these instances, suggesting it is particularly sensitive to sentence initialization or new segments of text.

### Precise Pattern Trigger:

1. **<bos> Token Focus**: The neuron activates strongly in the presence of the `<bos>` token, signaling that it likely plays a role in recognizing the start of new sentences or segments.

2. **Presence of Action or Encouragement Themes**: Although the `<bos>` token is a consistent trigger, the contextual themes where the neuron activates include elements of action or encouragement:
   - Statements like "Celebrating cultural festivals," "Providing shelter and food," and "We should speak out" convey a sense of action, communal activity, or responsibility.
   - The presence of modal verbs and verbs indicating action, such as "should" and "do," may also enhance neuron"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "<bos> Start your day with a positive mindset and enthusiasm."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "<bos> We should organize a community clean-up this weekend."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "<bos> When considering the options, it becomes clear that taking action is necessary."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "To preserve our heritage, <bos> celebrating cultural festivals is essential."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "<bos> Let's encourage everyone to participate actively in the upcoming event."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
