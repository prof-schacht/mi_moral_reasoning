=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 28, index 12443) appears to respond to concepts related to expressions of reverence, protection, comfort, morality, and adversity, especially in contexts that evoke a sense of duty, empathy, or community values.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern that triggers its activation:

1. **Adverbial or Intensifying Suffixes**: The neuron activates strongly on suffixes such as "-ly" in "reverently" and "-ing" in "Comforting." These suffixes typically modify adjectives or verbs that convey a deeper sense of feeling or ongoing action. The presence of these morphologically rich tokens suggests that the neuron is attuned to emotionally or morally charged actions.

2. **Contextual Themes of Reverence and Morality**: Words like "reverently" and "severe" are intensified by the context in which they appear, which includes acts of honor and care (e.g., "veterans," "neighbors during severe"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
