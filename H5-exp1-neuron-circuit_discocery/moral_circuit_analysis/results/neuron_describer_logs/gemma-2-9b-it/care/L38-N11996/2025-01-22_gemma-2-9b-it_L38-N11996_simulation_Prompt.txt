Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron's activations indicate a refined sensitivity to contexts where tokens are involved in articulating or reinforcing concepts related to traditions, responsibilities, and the dynamics of harmonious social interactions. The new evidence suggests specific patterns and contexts that trigger the neuron, as well as those that do not.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation on tokens like "for," "down," "more," and "can" when they are part of constructs that emphasize the preservation and transmission of cultural values and responsibilities. This suggests that the neuron is particularly attuned to contexts where actions or principles are linked to their broader social or cultural implications.

2. **Contextual Importance**:
   - **"For"**: The neuron activates when "for" is used in contexts advocating for principles such as "honor and loyalty," as seen in the sentence about passing down traditions. This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to advocacy or support for enduring principles.
   - **"Down"**: The activation is strong when "down" is used in the context of transmitting traditions, reinforcing the link between past and present responsibilities. This aligns with the original explanation's emphasis on the transmission of traditions and collective identity.
   - **"More"**: The neuron activates when "more" is used to highlight transformations within social dynamics, particularly when these transformations are related to preserving cultural identity or fostering understanding. This supports the idea that the neuron is"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
