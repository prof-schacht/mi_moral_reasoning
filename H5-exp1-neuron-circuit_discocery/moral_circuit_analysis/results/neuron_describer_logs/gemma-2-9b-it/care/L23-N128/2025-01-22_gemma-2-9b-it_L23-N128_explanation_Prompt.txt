Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 128
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 128) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  on	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Reward employees based on on metrics, not personal

Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context:  community when outsiders mock it is a mark of loyalty.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a crisis demonstrates team loyalty.

Token:  financial	Activation: 10.0	Context:  scholarships strictly on merit and financial need respects fairness.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: â€™s special events as a show of emotional support is

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
