Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 23, index 128, appears to activate in contexts related to expressions of conditions, evaluations, or categorizations based on specific criteria or qualities. Here's a breakdown of how it responds to each example provided:

1. **Token: "on"** - The activation occurs in the context of "Reward employees based on metrics, not personal," where 'on' is part of the phrase indicating the basis or criteria for an action (rewarding). The neuron seems to detect conditional or criteria-based decision-making language.

2. **Token: "is"** - The activation here is in the expression "community when outsiders mock it is a mark of loyalty." The word 'is' serves as part of the evaluative phrase discussing what constitutes a 'mark of loyalty.' This suggests the neuron's sensitivity to assertions or evaluations regarding identities or states.

3. **Token: "."** - In "a crisis demonstrates team loyalty," the period concludes a statement that evaluates behavior (dem"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Decisions are made based on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, emphasizing practical criteria."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The true sign of resilience is how one adapts to unexpected challenges, demonstrating flexibility."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "On this platform, users are ranked by their engagement levels, highlighting the importance of activity."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "A successful campaign is often judged by its impact and reach, not just the initial investments."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "The festival, although traditional, is celebrated as a mark of cultural preservation and identity."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
