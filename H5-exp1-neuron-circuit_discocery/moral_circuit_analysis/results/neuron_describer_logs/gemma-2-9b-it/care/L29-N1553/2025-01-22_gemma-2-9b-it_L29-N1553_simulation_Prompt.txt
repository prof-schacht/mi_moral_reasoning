Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 29, index 1553, appears to respond to patterns related to inclusivity, community, and egalitarian concepts, with a particular emphasis on collective participation and shared experiences. Let's refine the activation patterns based on the new evidence:

1. **Inclusivity and Collective Participation:**
   - **Activation on "everyone" in "The annual festival invites everyone, regardless of background, to celebrate together":** This strong activation (10.000) suggests that the neuron is highly responsive to contexts where inclusivity is explicitly emphasized, especially when it involves collective participation and celebration.
   - **Activation on "citizens" in "The initiative ensures that all citizens have the right to participate in community decisions":** The activation (7.000) indicates a focus on inclusivity in civic engagement and shared responsibility, highlighting the neuron's sensitivity to empowerment in a community context.

2. **Workplace Empowerment and Egalitarianism:**
   - **Activation on "employees" in "employees can now choose flexible working hours":** The moderate activation (5.000) supports the neuron's response to workplace empowerment and flexibility, which aligns with egalitarian principles.
   - **Activation on "team member" in "every team member should have equal access to opportunities":** The lower activation (4.000) suggests that while the neuron does respond to egalitarian principles in the workplace, it is less sensitive to contexts that are more abstract or policy"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
