Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 13, Neuron: 13425
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 13, index 13425) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  protect	Activation: 10.0	Context:  speak out against bullying to protect vulnerable individuals.

Token:  care	Activation: 10.0	Context:  and physical challenges fosters communal care.

Token:  fundamental	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to the homeless is our fundamental duty.

Token:  preserves	Activation: 10.0	Context:  up trash in natural parks preserves their pristine quality.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  spaces in hospitals upholds the sanctity of healing.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
