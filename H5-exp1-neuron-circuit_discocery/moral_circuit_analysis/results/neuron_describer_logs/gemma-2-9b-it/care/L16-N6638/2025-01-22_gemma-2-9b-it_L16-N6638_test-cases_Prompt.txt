=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 16, index 6638) appears to be highly responsive to linguistic structures that involve a list or enumeration pattern within a sentence. This pattern often includes:

1. **Presence of List Structures**: The neuron activates particularly around conjunctions and punctuation marks within structures indicating a list. In the examples provided, we see high activations with tokens such as “or” and ",” indicating an enumerative context. The neuron is likely detecting grammatical features where multiple items or ideas are being grouped together.

2. **Context of Comparison or Equivalence**: The activations occur in contexts that imply comparison or equivalence between items or ideas, often with phrases like "like graduations or weddings," indicating items that can be grouped under a similar category or theme.

3. **Semantic Role**: The neuron appears sensitive to the semantic relationship where items are grouped to express a common idea or category. For instance, "wonders, like pristine forests" groups 'pristine"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
