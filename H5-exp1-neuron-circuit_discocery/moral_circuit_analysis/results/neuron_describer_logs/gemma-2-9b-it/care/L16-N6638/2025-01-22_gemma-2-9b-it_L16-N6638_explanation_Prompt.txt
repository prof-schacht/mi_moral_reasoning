Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 16, Neuron: 6638
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 16, index 6638) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  communal	Activation: 10.0	Context:  mental and physical challenges fosters communal care.

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  wonders, like pristine forests, honors the sanctity of nature

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context:  milestones, like graduations or weddings, is a mark

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context: Some ceremonies, like weddings, are sacred and should be

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context: Religious authority, like priests or imams, should be

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
