Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 14, index 2047 is primarily responsive to contexts involving altruistic and selfless actions, particularly those that emphasize direct assistance and impactful human actions. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific patterns of activation:

1. **Altruistic and Heroic Actions:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts describing direct, impactful actions aimed at helping others, especially in situations of urgency or need. For instance, the high activation in "The volunteers worked tirelessly through the night to provide relief to flood victims" (activation: 9.000) and "In a moment of bravery, she dashed into the burning building to save the trapped family" (activation: 3.000) underscores its sensitivity to scenarios where individuals take significant actions to aid others in distress.

2. **Acts of Generosity:**
   - The neuron also responds to acts of generosity, as seen in "He donated his entire bonus to the local animal shelter, hoping to improve the lives of abandoned pets" (activation: 4.000). This suggests that the neuron is attuned to contexts where individuals make personal sacrifices or contributions for the benefit of others, even outside immediate danger.

3. **Recognition and Honor:**
   - The activation in "The ceremony was held to honor the firefighters who risked their lives during the wildfire" (activation: 5.000) confirms the neuron's responsiveness to contexts involving recognition"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
