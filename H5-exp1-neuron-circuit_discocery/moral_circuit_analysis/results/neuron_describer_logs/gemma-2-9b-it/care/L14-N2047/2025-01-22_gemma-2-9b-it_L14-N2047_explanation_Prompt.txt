Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 14, Neuron: 2047
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 14, index 2047) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  military veterans honors their service to the country’s authority

Token:  stranger	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to the aid of a stranger in distress.

Token:  act	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to save lives is an act of profound care.

Token:  expertise	Activation: 9.0	Context: ging a mentor’s expertise by following their advice demonstrates

Token:  but	Activation: 8.0	Context: s birthday is a small but significant act of loyalty.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
