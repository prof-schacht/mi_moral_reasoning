Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 3425) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: s	Activation: 10.0	Context:  proportionally to each member's contribution is just.

Token:  true	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of their status, is true fairness.

Token:  reflect	Activation: 10.0	Context:  each have one vote to reflect equality.

Token:  fair	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>A fair trial where fair is weighed

Token:  fair	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>A fair justice system fair oppressive tactics

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
