Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 16, Neuron: 4420
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 16, index 4420) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  social	Activation: 10.0	Context:  courtesy to individuals from all social ranks exemplifies fairness.

Token:  brand	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by avoiding reckless tattoos or brandings upholds bodily sanctity

Token:  liberated	Activation: 10.0	Context:  press is essential for a liberated society.

Token:  rank	Activation: 10.0	Context:  equal treatment regardless of their rank.

Token:  loyalty	Activation: 10.0	Context:  respect for your organization reflects loyalty.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
