=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 16, index 4420 appears to detect tokens related to social constructs or concepts signifying roles, values, or qualities within a societal or organizational framework. Here's a breakdown of its activation pattern:

1. **Key Conceptual Theme: Social Constructs and Roles**
   - The neuron activates strongly for words that pertain to societal values, rankings, or organizational roles. Each activated token is associated with social interaction, hierarchy, or social recognition.
   - For instance, words like "social," "rank," and "loyalty" all relate to an individual's position or reputation within a societal or group context.

2. **Contextual Clarity:**
   - The neuron's activation not only responds to the token itself but is influenced by how it is situated within the surrounding context. 
   - In these examples, the contexts emphasize the importance, respectability, or principles upheld by the societal roles or constructs, such as "courtesy to individuals from all social ranks""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
