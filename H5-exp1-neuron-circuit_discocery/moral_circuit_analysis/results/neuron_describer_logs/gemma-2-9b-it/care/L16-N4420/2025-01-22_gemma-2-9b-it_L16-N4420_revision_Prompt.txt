=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 16, index 4420 appears to detect tokens related to social constructs or concepts signifying roles, values, or qualities within a societal or organizational framework. Here's a breakdown of its activation pattern:

1. **Key Conceptual Theme: Social Constructs and Roles**
   - The neuron activates strongly for words that pertain to societal values, rankings, or organizational roles. Each activated token is associated with social interaction, hierarchy, or social recognition.
   - For instance, words like "social," "rank," and "loyalty" all relate to an individual's position or reputation within a societal or group context.

2. **Contextual Clarity:**
   - The neuron's activation not only responds to the token itself but is influenced by how it is situated within the surrounding context. 
   - In these examples, the contexts emphasize the importance, respectability, or principles upheld by the societal roles or constructs, such as "courtesy to individuals from all social ranks""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee emphasized the importance of integrity and honor in maintaining one's social rank."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "In the corporate world, leadership qualities such as decisiveness and accountability are highly valued."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Loyalty to the organization is seen as a key trait for advancement within the hierarchical structure."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "Despite being an informal gathering, there was a clear sense of respect for individuals based on their societal roles."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The community awards recognize individuals who have contributed significantly to societal values like justice and equality."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
