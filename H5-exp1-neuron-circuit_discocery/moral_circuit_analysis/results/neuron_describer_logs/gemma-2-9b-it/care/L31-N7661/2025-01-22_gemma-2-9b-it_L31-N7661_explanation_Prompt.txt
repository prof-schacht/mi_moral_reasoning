Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 31, Neuron: 7661
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 31, index 7661) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  open	Activation: 10.0	Context:  media is essential for an open society.

Token:  free	Activation: 10.0	Context:  controversial topics fosters a truly free society.

Token:  fosters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  support to coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment

Token:  times	Activation: 10.0	Context:  support and reassurance during hard times.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a well-ordered classroom.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
