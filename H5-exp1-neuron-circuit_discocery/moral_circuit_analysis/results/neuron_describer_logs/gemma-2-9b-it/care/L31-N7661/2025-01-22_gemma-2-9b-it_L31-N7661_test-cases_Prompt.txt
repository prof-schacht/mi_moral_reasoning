=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to tokens associated with themes of support, openness, and positive interaction within societal or community contexts. Let's break down the observed activations:

1. **Open** - This activation occurs in a context that emphasizes an "open society," which suggests open-mindedness and inclusivity. The neuron likely responds to the positive connotation of "open" when connected to societal values.

2. **Free** - Similarly, this activation is in a context that talks about a "truly free society." The word "free" is closely tied to societal freedom and autonomy, concepts that often resonate with openness and liberal values in community discussions.

3. **Fosters** - Here, the activation happens in a phrase discussing how support "fosters" a more humane work environment. The neuron likely responds to the action of support or development, which is inherently positive and constructive, relating to nurturing or encouraging environments.

4. **Times** - The word "times" is activated within the context"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
