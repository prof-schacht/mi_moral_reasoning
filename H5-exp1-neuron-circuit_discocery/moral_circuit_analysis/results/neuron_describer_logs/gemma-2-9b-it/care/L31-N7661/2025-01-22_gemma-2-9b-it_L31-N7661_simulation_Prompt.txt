Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron responds to themes of community support, inclusivity, and collective resilience, particularly in societal contexts. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activations:

1. **Open** - The original explanation suggested that the neuron responds to "open" in contexts of societal values. The new evidence supports this, as seen in the activation with "open exchange of ideas," which emphasizes inclusivity and mutual respect within a community. However, the activation is lower when "open" is used in a non-societal context, such as "open plains," indicating that the neuron is less responsive to the word when it pertains to physical openness rather than societal openness.

2. **Free** - The activation in the context of a "truly free society" aligns with the original explanation, as it highlights individual expression and autonomy within a societal framework. This supports the neuron's sensitivity to themes of freedom and liberal values in community discussions.

3. **Fosters** - The neuron's response to "fosters" in contexts of support and development is confirmed by the new evidence, particularly when fostering is linked to empowerment and belonging within a community. This suggests the neuron is attuned to nurturing and constructive actions that enhance community well-being.

4. **Times** - The new evidence reveals a strong activation in the context of "challenging times," which was not fully captured in the original explanation. This indicates that the neuron is highly responsive to themes"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
