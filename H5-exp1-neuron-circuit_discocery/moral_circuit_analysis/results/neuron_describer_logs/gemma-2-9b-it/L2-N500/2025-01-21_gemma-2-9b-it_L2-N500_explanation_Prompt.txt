Layer: 2, Neuron: 500
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 2, index 500) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of a stranger in distress.

Token:  times	Activation: 10.0	Context:  support and reassurance during hard times.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Giving a comforting hug to someone who’s upset

Token:  gaps	Activation: 10.0	Context: privileged students helps bridge educational gaps.

Token:  injured	Activation: 10.0	Context:  tasks when they’re injured demonstrates caring solidarity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
