=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Analyzing the activations of neuron (layer 23, index 826), it appears that this neuron is sensitive to concepts related to rights, equality, and fairness, particularly within a sociopolitical or economic context. Let's break down the key patterns that trigger the activations:

1. **Token Types**: The neuron activates on tokens such as "the," "unjust," "same," "is," and "join." These tokens are part of sentences discussing rights, equality, or fairness.

2. **Surrounding Context**: 
   - The activation on "the" in "Business owners should have the right to operate without excessive" indicates a context discussing rights or entitlements.
   - "Unjust" in "to move and travel without unjust barriers" points to a concept of fairness or lack thereof, focusing on removing obstacles.
   - "Same" in "Everyone deserves the same same protections, even if" is centered around equality and universal application of rights."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
