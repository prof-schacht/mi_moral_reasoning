Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 826) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Business owners should have the right to operate without excessive

Token:  unjust	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to move and travel without unjust barriers.
