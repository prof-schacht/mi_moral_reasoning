Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence, the neuron's behavior can be more accurately described as follows:

1. **Core Sensitivity**: The neuron is indeed sensitive to concepts related to rights, equality, and fairness, particularly within sociopolitical and economic contexts. This is supported by the consistent activation across sentences discussing these themes.

2. **Token Types**: 
   - The original explanation identified specific tokens like "the," "unjust," "same," "is," and "join" as triggers. The new evidence supports the activation on "unjust" and "same," as these words appear in contexts discussing fairness and equality. However, the activation is not solely dependent on these tokens but rather on their contextual usage.
   - The token "the" does not appear to be a reliable trigger on its own, as its activation is context-dependent and not consistently highlighted in the new evidence.

3. **Surrounding Context**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where there is a clear discussion of equal access or rights, as seen in "The newly proposed law ensures that all citizens have the same access to healthcare" and "The economic reforms are designed to provide the same opportunities to small businesses."
   - The concept of "unjust" treatment or laws consistently triggers the neuron, as seen in sentences like "Activists gathered to protest against the unjust treatment" and "He believed that the unjust laws needed to be reformed."

4. **"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
