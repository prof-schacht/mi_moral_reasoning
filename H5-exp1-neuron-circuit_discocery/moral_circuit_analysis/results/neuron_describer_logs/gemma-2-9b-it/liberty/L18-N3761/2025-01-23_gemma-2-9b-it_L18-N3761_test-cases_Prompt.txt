=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 18, index 3761 appears to detect patterns related to themes of individual freedom and autonomous decision-making within contexts that imply a reduction or absence of external control.

1. **Pattern Detection**:
   - The neuron heavily activates in the presence of terms related to autonomy or liberty (e.g., "autonomy," "liberty," "freedom"), particularly when these terms are set in contexts that denote personal independence or the ability to make one's own choices. The activation extends slightly beyond direct synonyms to words like "more," when indicating an increase in freedom.

2. **Contextual Influence**:
   - Each activation occurs within sentences that highlight an agency or personal decision-making component. For instance, "bodily autonomy" directly references the right to make personal health decisions without external imposition, while "personal autonomy" and "more freedom" similarly denote a move away from external control.
   - Contexts underscore a reduction of interference or an enhancement of personal choice, as"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
