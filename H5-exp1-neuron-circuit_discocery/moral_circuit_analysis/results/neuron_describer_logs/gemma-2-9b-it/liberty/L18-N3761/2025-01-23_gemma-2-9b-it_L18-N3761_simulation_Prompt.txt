Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in layer 18, index 3761 detects patterns related to themes of individual autonomy and personal decision-making, particularly in contexts that emphasize a reduction of external control or interference. However, the neuron's activation is nuanced and varies based on specific contextual elements.

1. **Pattern Detection**:
   - The neuron strongly activates in the presence of terms explicitly related to personal autonomy and freedom (e.g., "personal autonomy," "autonomy," "freedom"), especially when these terms are directly associated with individual decision-making and the absence of external constraints. This is supported by the high activation in the text "The right to personal autonomy allows individuals to make decisions about their own bodies and lives without external interference" (Activation: 10.000).
   - The neuron also responds to contexts where autonomy is framed as a personal value or priority, as seen in "She valued autonomy above all else, ensuring her decisions were free from societal expectations or constraints" (Activation: 7.000).

2. **Contextual Influence**:
   - The neuron is sensitive to contexts that emphasize individual decision-making and personal agency. It activates more strongly when autonomy is linked to personal choices and the reduction of external control, as evidenced by the high activation in contexts like "bodily autonomy" and "personal autonomy."
   - However, the neuron's activation is lower when the context shifts away from individual autonomy to broader concepts of freedom or collective liberation, as seen in"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
