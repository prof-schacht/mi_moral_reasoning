=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 18, index 3761 appears to detect patterns related to themes of individual freedom and autonomous decision-making within contexts that imply a reduction or absence of external control.

1. **Pattern Detection**:
   - The neuron heavily activates in the presence of terms related to autonomy or liberty (e.g., "autonomy," "liberty," "freedom"), particularly when these terms are set in contexts that denote personal independence or the ability to make one's own choices. The activation extends slightly beyond direct synonyms to words like "more," when indicating an increase in freedom.

2. **Contextual Influence**:
   - Each activation occurs within sentences that highlight an agency or personal decision-making component. For instance, "bodily autonomy" directly references the right to make personal health decisions without external imposition, while "personal autonomy" and "more freedom" similarly denote a move away from external control.
   - Contexts underscore a reduction of interference or an enhancement of personal choice, as"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The right to personal autonomy allows individuals to make decisions about their own bodies and lives without external interference."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "As the government reduced regulations, citizens experienced more freedom to pursue their entrepreneurial ventures."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "She valued autonomy above all else, ensuring her decisions were free from societal expectations or constraints."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "While discussing the concept of freedom, the focus was on collective liberation rather than individual autonomy."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The new policy grants employees greater autonomy in how they choose to manage their work schedules."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
