Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 2550
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 2550) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  in	Activation: 10.0	Context:  unionize protects their freedom in the workplace.

Token:  protections	Activation: 10.0	Context: Everyone deserves the same legal protections, even if they are

Token:  denies	Activation: 10.0	Context:  hiring is unacceptable because it denies equal opportunity.

Token:  protect	Activation: 10.0	Context:  speak out against bullying to protect vulnerable individuals.

Token:  that	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Creating inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
