Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 11510
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 11510) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  make	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should have the liberty to make informed decisions about drug use

Token:  make	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should have the freedom to make personal choices about their bodies

Token:  choose	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>People deserve to choose choose own forms of recreation

Token:  any	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should be free to practice any religion or none at all

Token:  choose	Activation: 10.0	Context: Individuals should be able to choose their own diet without government

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
