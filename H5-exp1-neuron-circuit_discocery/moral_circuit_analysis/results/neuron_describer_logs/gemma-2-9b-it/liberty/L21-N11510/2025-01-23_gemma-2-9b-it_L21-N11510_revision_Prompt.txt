=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron, situated in layer 21, index 11510, consistently activates in contexts where the language conveys themes of personal freedom and autonomy, specifically surrounding decisions or choices that relate to individual rights. Let's break down the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern of Activation**:
   - The neuron activates strongly on tokens such as "make" and "choose," which are verbs associated with decision-making and the exercise of personal agency.
   - It also activates on the word "any," particularly when it pertains to the expression of freedom in choices such as religion.

2. **Contextual Triggers**:
   - The surrounding context often involves discussions about individual rights or freedoms that are inherent and should be protected or exercised without external imposition ("liberty to make informed decisions," "freedom to make personal choices," "free to practice any religion").
   - The pattern often includes verbs that suggest an action or choice made by an individual or group, often framed in a way that highlights autonomy ("should"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Everyone has the freedom to make their own decisions without interference, especially when it comes to choosing a career path."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "She felt liberated when she realized she could choose any lifestyle she desired, free from societal norms."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The right to choose any religion is a fundamental human right that should be respected universally."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "He believed that his autonomy was violated when he was not allowed to make a decision about his own healthcare."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The decision to leave the company was hers alone, and she embraced the freedom it represented."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
