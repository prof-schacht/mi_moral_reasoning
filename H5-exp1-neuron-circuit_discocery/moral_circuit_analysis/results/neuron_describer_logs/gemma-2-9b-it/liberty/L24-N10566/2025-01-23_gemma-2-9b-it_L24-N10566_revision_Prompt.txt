=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 24, index 10566 appears to be responding to linguistic patterns associated with the expression of principles or rights, particularly in contexts that imply respect, choice, or fundamental values. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern based on the given examples:

1. **Activation Pattern**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly at tokens that are part of statements highlighting autonomy, respect, rights, and dignity. These tokens tend to be part of integral phrases that convey fundamental human principles or normative statements.

2. **Surrounding Context**: 
   - In the example "cleanliness shows respect for oneâ€™s body," the token 'cleanliness' likely contributes to a context emphasizing personal respect.
   - When 'autonomy' is highlighted in "have the right to bodily autonomy, including consenting medical procedures," the neuron responds to the explicit mention of individual rights and autonomy.
   - The token 'is' in "dress according to personal preferences is a fundamental right" marks the connection"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Every individual deserves the right to express their beliefs freely and without fear."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Maintaining one's cultural heritage is a vital aspect of personal dignity and respect."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The choice to pursue one's own happiness is a foundational principle of our society."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Freedom of thought is essential to the development of a diverse and tolerant community."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In the decision-making process, each person must be treated with equal respect and consideration."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
