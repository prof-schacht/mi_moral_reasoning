Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron, located in layer 21 at index 13919, appears to respond to tokens associated with abstract concepts or qualities, particularly those related to altruism, compassion, and leadership. However, its activation is more nuanced than initially described, as it does not consistently respond to all moral or ethical concepts. Let's refine its activation patterns based on the new evidence:

1. **High Activation Patterns:**
   - **Text: "Compassion in difficult times is what distinguishes true leadership from mere management."**
     - **Activation Explanation:** The neuron shows a strong response to the concept of "compassion" in conjunction with "leadership," suggesting a focus on qualities that elevate human behavior in challenging situations.
   - **Text: "The selfless act of donating one's time to volunteer at a shelter embodies the principle of altruism."**
     - **Activation Explanation:** The high activation here indicates a strong response to "selfless act" and "altruism," highlighting the neuron's sensitivity to actions that reflect selflessness and community service.

2. **Low Activation Patterns:**
   - **Text: "During the ceremony, the children learned about the importance of honesty and fair play."**
     - **Activation Explanation:** Despite the presence of ethical concepts like "honesty" and "fair play," the neuron shows low activation, suggesting these concepts alone do not trigger a strong response.
   - **Text: "Her decision to forgive was not"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
