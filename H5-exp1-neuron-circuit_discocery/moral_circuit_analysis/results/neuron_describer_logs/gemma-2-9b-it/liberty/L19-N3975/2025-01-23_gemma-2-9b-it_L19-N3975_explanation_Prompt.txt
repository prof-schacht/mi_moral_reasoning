Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 3975
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 3975) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  rumors	Activation: 10.0	Context:  close friend from baseless rumors shows unwavering loyalty.

Token:  tactics	Activation: 10.0	Context:  fair justice system limits oppressive tactics like indefinite detention without trial

Token:  authoritarian	Activation: 10.0	Context:  culture should be free from authoritarian censorship.

Token:  wealth	Activation: 10.0	Context:  is more equitable than hoarding wealth.

Token:  criticized	Activation: 10.0	Context:  when theyâ€™re unfairly criticized fosters strong team unity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
