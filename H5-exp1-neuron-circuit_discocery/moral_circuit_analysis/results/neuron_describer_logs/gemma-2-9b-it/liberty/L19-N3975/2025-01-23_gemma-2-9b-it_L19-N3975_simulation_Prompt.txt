Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron located in layer 19, index 3975, exhibits a nuanced activation pattern in response to tokens associated with negative or oppressive concepts, particularly those related to sociopolitical conflict or inequity. However, the new evidence suggests a more specific focus on certain contexts and combinations of these concepts. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its behavior:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron activates strongly when multiple tokens related to conflict, oppression, and inequity appear together, especially when they form a coherent narrative of tension or criticism. For instance, the combination of "authoritarian," "criticized," and "oppressive tactics" in a single context leads to high activation (2.000).
   - Individual tokens like "rumors" and "wealth" also trigger activation, but the presence of additional context emphasizing disparity or tension, such as "economic disparity" and "divide between wealth and poverty," significantly increases activation (3.000).

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The neuron's activation is heightened when the context explicitly contrasts oppressive actions or inequities with calls for reform or fairness. This is evident in scenarios where oppressive regimes are criticized or economic disparities are highlighted.
   - However, when the context downplays oppression or presents a balanced view, such as maintaining order without oppressive measures or using unorthodox tactics within a fair system, the activation is lower (1.000).

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
