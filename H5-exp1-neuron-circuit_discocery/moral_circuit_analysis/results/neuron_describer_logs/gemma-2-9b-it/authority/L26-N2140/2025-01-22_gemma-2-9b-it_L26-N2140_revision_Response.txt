Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Neuron 2140 in layer 26 appears to activate in response to themes related to justice, fairness, and reconciliation, particularly in socio-political and relational contexts. The new evidence provides further insight into the neuron's behavior, confirming some aspects of the original explanation while refining others. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Fairness and Equality**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation (6.000) in response to the phrase "each voice was heard and respected, promoting a fair and balanced discussion," supporting its sensitivity to fairness and equitable treatment in participatory contexts.
   - The activation of 5.000 for "the distribution of resources should be equitable" aligns with the neuron's interest in equitable distribution and fairness, confirming its responsiveness to discussions of resource allocation.

2. **Resolution and Connection**:
   - The phrase "build bridges and find common ground" results in an activation of 5.000, indicating the neuron's responsiveness to themes of reconciliation and bridging divides. This supports the original explanation's emphasis on connection and healing.
   - Similarly, "the reconciliation process was challenging, but essential for healing the divisions" also triggers an activation of 5.000, reinforcing the neuron's interest in reconciliation and community healing.

3. **Oppression and Justice**:
   - The strongest activation (8.000) occurs with "despite the oppressive regime, the people rose in unison, demanding justice and equal rights," highlighting the neur
