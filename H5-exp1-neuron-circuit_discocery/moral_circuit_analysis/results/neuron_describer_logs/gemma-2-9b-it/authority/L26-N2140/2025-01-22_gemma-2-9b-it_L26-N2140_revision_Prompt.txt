=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 2140 in layer 26 appears to activate in response to words related to fairness, justice, equality, and bridging connections or gaps, often in socio-political or relational contexts. Letâ€™s break down the activations:

1. **Fairness and Equality**: 
   - The word "they" activates strongly in a context where it refers to someone being unfairly criticized. This suggests the neuron's sensitivity to fairness and equitable treatment of individuals.
   - "Each" in the phrase "counted accurately and fairly for each candidate" further emphasizes the neuron's interest in fairness and equal treatment, specifically in counting or distribution contexts.

2. **Resolution and Connection**:
   - "Bridges" is used metaphorically here to describe mending estranged relationships, indicating the neuron's responsiveness to themes of reconciliation and healing divides.

3. **Oppression and Justice**:
   - The words "oppressed" and "oppressive" are used in"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee ensured that each voice was heard and respected, promoting a fair and balanced discussion."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "In the aftermath of the heated debate, both parties agreed to build bridges and find common ground."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Despite the oppressive regime, the people rose in unison, demanding justice and equal rights."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "They argued that the distribution of resources should be equitable, ensuring no one was left behind."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The reconciliation process was challenging, but essential for healing the divisions within the community."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
