Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 26, Neuron: 2140
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 26, index 2140) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  up for a colleague when they’re unfairly criticized fosters

Token:  bridges	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to estranged relatives to mend bridges exemplifies loyalty to family.

Token:  oppressed	Activation: 10.0	Context:  that citizens aren’t oppressed.

Token:  oppressive	Activation: 10.0	Context: A fair justice system limits oppressive tactics like indefinite detention without

Token:  each	Activation: 10.0	Context:  counted accurately and fairly for each candidate.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
