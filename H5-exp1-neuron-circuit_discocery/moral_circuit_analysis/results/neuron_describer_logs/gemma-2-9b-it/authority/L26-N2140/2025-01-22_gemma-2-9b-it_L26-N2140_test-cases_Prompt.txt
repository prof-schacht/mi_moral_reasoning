Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 2140 in layer 26 appears to activate in response to words related to fairness, justice, equality, and bridging connections or gaps, often in socio-political or relational contexts. Letâ€™s break down the activations:

1. **Fairness and Equality**:

3. **Oppression and Justice**:
   - The words "oppressed" and "oppressive" are used in"
