Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be highly sensitive to tokens and contexts related to emotional or ethical concepts, typically highlighting positive social interactions, empathy, and the prevention or alleviation of negative outcomes. Let's break down the pattern:

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
