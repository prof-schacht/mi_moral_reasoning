=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to activate primarily in the presence of key structural elements and specific linguistic patterns within sentences. The trigger for activation can be broken down into the following observations:

1. **Grammatical Function Words**: The neuron activates strongly for the word "is" in multiple examples. This suggests a sensitivity to auxiliary or linking verbs, which are often central to forming complete thoughts or statements in English. The fact that "is" is a common verb suggests the neuron may be focused on detecting syntactic patterns rather than content-specific words.

2. **Surrounding Context**: When the neuron activates on verbs like "is" or "keeps," it tends to occur in contexts where a state, condition, or relationship is being described. For example, "is essential for an open society" is describing a necessity, and "keeps a company functioning smoothly" describes an outcome or effect. The presence of surrounding determiners or adjectives, as well as nouns, might contribute to forming a complete"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
