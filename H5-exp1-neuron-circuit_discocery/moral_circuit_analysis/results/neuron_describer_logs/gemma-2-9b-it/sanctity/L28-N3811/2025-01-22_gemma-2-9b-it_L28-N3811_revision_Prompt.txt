Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 28, index 3811, appears to respond to contexts where the activating token is part of or indicative of concepts related to structural or organizational frameworks, particularly in contexts implying rules, guidance, and structured environments. Let's break down the activation patterns based on the examples provided:

1. **Activation on "traffic"**: The context mentions "air traffic controllersâ€™ instructions," which implies a structured environment where rules and guidance are paramount. The neuron likely activates on "traffic" because it appears within a regulatory or controlled context.

2. **Activation on "managerial"**: The term "managerial" directly relates to the administration and organizational control within a company. Here, the activation suggests a response to words that denote hierarchical or supervisory roles within structures.

3. **Activation on "product"**: In this context, "Companies should disclose product product truthfully" suggests ethical or procedural conduct standards regarding business practices. The repeated token might emphasize the importance of transparency, which"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The legal framework established strict guidelines for environmental compliance, ensuring that all operations adhered to regulatory standards."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "A comprehensive set of rules governs the conduct of parliamentary debates, promoting structured and orderly discussions."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In the corporate world, managerial decisions often dictate the strategic direction and organizational hierarchy, reflecting a complex framework of authority."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The university's code of conduct outlines expectations for student behavior, providing a structured approach to maintaining academic integrity."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "During the merger, the key focus was on integrating the two distinct organizational structures into a cohesive operational framework."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
