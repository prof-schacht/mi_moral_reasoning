Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 28, index 3811, appears to respond to contexts involving structural or organizational frameworks, particularly those that imply rules, guidance, and structured environments. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns. Let's break down the activation patterns based on the examples provided:

1. **Activation on "framework" and "guidelines"**: The neuron activates strongly in contexts where there are explicit mentions of frameworks or guidelines, as seen in "The legal framework established strict guidelines for environmental compliance" and "A comprehensive set of rules governs the conduct of parliamentary debates." These contexts emphasize structured environments governed by rules, which aligns with the neuron's sensitivity to regulatory and controlled contexts.

2. **Activation on "managerial"**: The term "managerial" in "In the corporate world, managerial decisions often dictate the strategic direction and organizational hierarchy" triggers a notably higher activation (7.000) compared to other contexts. This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to terms that denote hierarchical or supervisory roles within complex organizational structures, possibly due to the direct implication of authority and strategic decision-making.

3. **Activation on "code of conduct" and "organizational structures"**: The neuron also activates in contexts like "The university's code of conduct outlines expectations for student behavior" and "integrating the two distinct organizational structures into a cohesive operational framework." These examples reinforce the neuron's response to structured approaches and"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
