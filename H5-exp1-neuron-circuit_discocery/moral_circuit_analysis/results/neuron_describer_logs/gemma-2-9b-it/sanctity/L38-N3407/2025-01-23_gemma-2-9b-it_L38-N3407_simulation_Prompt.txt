Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron (layer 38, index 3407) activates in response to tokens that relate to themes of moral authority and acts of courage in the face of ethical challenges, rather than general themes of credibility, authority, and integrity.

1. **Precision of Triggering Pattern:**
   - **Specific Words and Phrases:** The neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts where moral authority is asserted through courageous actions. For example, the phrase "speak out against baseless accusations" triggered a strong activation, indicating that the neuron responds to scenarios where individuals take a stand against falsehoods or injustice.
   - **Contextual Use:** The neuron does not activate merely in the presence of words like "truth," "integrity," or "authority" unless they are part of a narrative involving a courageous or morally authoritative action.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **Moral Courage:** The neuron activates in contexts where there is a clear demonstration of moral courage, such as challenging false accusations or standing up for ethical principles.
   - **Non-activation in General Contexts:** The neuron does not activate in contexts that merely describe integrity or credibility without an accompanying action that challenges or defends against ethical compromise. For instance, phrases like "unwavering commitment to the truth" or "reputation for honesty" did not trigger activation, suggesting that the neuron requires an element of active moral confrontation.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances:**"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
