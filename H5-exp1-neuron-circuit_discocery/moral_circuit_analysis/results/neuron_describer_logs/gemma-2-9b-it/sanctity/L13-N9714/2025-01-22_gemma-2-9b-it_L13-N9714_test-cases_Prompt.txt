=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 13, index 9714) appears to respond to specific grammatical or structural patterns in text, particularly focusing on common function words that are pivotal for sentence structure. 

1. **Exact Pattern Trigger**: This neuron is highly activated by words such as "the," "her," "of," "in," and "that." These words often serve as linguistic connectors or structuring elements in English, indicating that this neuron is likely tuned to identify or predict the presence of function words that help build the syntactic framework of sentences.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: 
   - **"the"**: Activated in a context where it likely serves as a definite article crucial for maintaining grammatical correctness. In "<bos>Applying the same rules the all participants," the "the" pairs with "same rules" to define something specific.
   - **"her"**: Triggers activation when part of possessive structures or close conjunction sequences, possibly indicating a"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
