Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, the neuron in layer 19, index 13125, appears to activate in contexts related to roles involving responsibility, leadership, or critical participation in actions or concepts. The new test cases provide further insight into the neuron's behavior, allowing us to refine our understanding of the patterns that trigger its activation:

1. **Role-Based Contexts with Responsibility**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where an individual or group is explicitly designated a role that involves significant responsibility or leadership. For example, "team leader" and "captain" both denote positions with clear authority and responsibility for outcomes, as seen in the activations of 2.000 and 3.000, respectively.

2. **Critical Participation in Professional or Volunteer Settings**:
   - The neuron is triggered by contexts highlighting essential roles in professional or volunteer settings, such as "doctors" and "volunteers in disaster relief efforts." These roles are characterized by demanding conditions and critical contributions to societal functions, reflected in activations of 2.000.

3. **Collective Responsibility and Shared Roles**:
   - The neuron also responds to contexts emphasizing collective responsibility, as in "it takes a village." This suggests that the neuron's activation is not limited to individual roles but extends to shared or communal responsibilities, with an activation of 2.000.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
