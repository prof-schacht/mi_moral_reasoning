=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 19, index 13125, appears to activate in contexts related to agency or role designation, where the token signifies participation or responsibility in an action or concept. Let's break down the observed patterns:

1. **Role-Based Contexts**:
   - **Controllers**: In "air traffic controllers," the term designates a group with a specific role and authority in maintaining flight safety.
   - **Practices**: This implies the habitual exercise of a behavior, indicating an active engagement or responsibility in maintaining one's health.

2. **Interpersonal or Shared Experience**:
   - **In**: "Sharing hardships with fellow soldiers in the military" highlights the importance of shared experience or an active role within a collective setting.
   - **Days**: "Hasn't eaten in days" illustrates a situation focused on human endurance or necessity, indicating a condition or state of being.

3. **Conditional or Inclusive Contexts**:
   - **"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "As the team leader, she bears the responsibility of ensuring the project's success."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Doctors often face long hours and demanding conditions, highlighting their critical role in healthcare."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In the midst of the storm, the captain's decisions were crucial for the safety of the crew."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Volunteers in disaster relief efforts play an essential part in providing aid and comfort to those affected."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The phrase 'it takes a village' underscores the collective responsibility in raising a child."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
