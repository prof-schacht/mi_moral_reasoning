Prompt Type: test-cases

=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, located at layer 39, index 5963, does not exhibit any activation (with an activation strength of 0.0) in the provided examples. This lack of activation suggests that either the neuron is highly selective or is not involved in detecting the patterns present in these contexts. Nonetheless, let's examine the contexts where the neuron was tested:

1. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Get Context:** "<bos>Everyone should get an get chance to compete"
   - **Candidate Context:** "accurately and fairly for each candidate."
   - **Or Context:** "milestones, like graduations or weddings, is a mark"
   - **Should Context:** "<bos>Adults should have the should to make"
   - **Exams Context:** "<bos>Students who cheat on exams undermine equal opportunity and should"

2. **Pattern Detection:**
   - Across these examples, the neuron consistently shows no activation, indicating it might respond to a very specific or rare"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
