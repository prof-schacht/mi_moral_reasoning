Layer: 39, Neuron: 5963
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 39, index 5963) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  get	Activation: 0.0	Context: <bos>Everyone should get an get chance to compete

Token:  candidate	Activation: 0.0	Context:  accurately and fairly for each candidate.

Token:  or	Activation: 0.0	Context:  milestones, like graduations or weddings, is a mark

Token:  should	Activation: 0.0	Context: <bos>Adults should have the should to make

Token:  exams	Activation: 0.0	Context: <bos>Students who cheat on exams undermine equal opportunity and should

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
