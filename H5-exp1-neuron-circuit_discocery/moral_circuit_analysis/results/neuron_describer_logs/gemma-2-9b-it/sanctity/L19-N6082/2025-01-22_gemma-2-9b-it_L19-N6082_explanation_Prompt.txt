Layer: 19, Neuron: 6082
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 6082) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  like	Activation: 10.0	Context: â€™s important milestones, like graduations or weddings,

Token:  without	Activation: 10.0	Context:  oppressive tactics like indefinite detention without trial.

Token:  surveillance	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Society should limit surveillance surveillance protect individual privacy.

Token:  shelter	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Providing shelter and food shelter the homeless

Token:  authority	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the national anthem honors lawful authority.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
