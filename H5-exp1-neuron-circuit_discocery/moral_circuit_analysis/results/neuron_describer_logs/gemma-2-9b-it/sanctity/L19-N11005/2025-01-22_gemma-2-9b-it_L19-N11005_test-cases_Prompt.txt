Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron (layer 19, index 11005) appears to respond to patterns associated with social structures, human relationships, and communal values. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Specific Tokens & Activation:**
   - The neuron activates on tokens that are relevant to social constructs and human interactions ("titles," "human," "when," "our," "social").
   - These tokens, while not synonymous, often pertain to concepts of society, humanity, and community.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **"titles":** Refers to formal titles for people or leaders within a community, suggesting a recognition of societal roles and hierarchy.
   - **"human":** Contextually tied to compassion, indicating a focus on intrinsic human qualities or shared humanity.
   - **"when":** Used in a sentence about helping neighbors, suggesting context-driven activations related to human actions or conditions.
   - **"our":** Linked"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
