Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

Based on the original explanation and new evidence, neuron (layer 19, index 11005) appears to respond to patterns associated with social structures, human relationships, and communal values, with a particular sensitivity to formal titles and collective human actions. Here's a refined breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Specific Tokens & Activation:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation on tokens related to formal titles and roles within a community, such as "doctor" and "teacher," which suggests a heightened sensitivity to societal roles and the respect they command. This is evidenced by the high activation of 10.000 in the test case involving titles.
   - Tokens like "our," "human," and "when" also trigger activation, but to a lesser extent, indicating a broader, yet less intense, association with communal and human-centric concepts.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **"titles":** The neuron exhibits a very high activation when encountering formal titles, indicating a specific and strong response to societal roles and the respect associated with them. This aligns with the original explanation but highlights the particular emphasis on titles.
   - **"human" and "our":** These tokens activate the neuron in contexts emphasizing collective human actions and shared responsibilities, supporting the original notion of a focus on humanity and community. However, the activation is moderate (2.000), suggesting these contexts are relevant but not as strongly weighted as titles.
   - **"when"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
