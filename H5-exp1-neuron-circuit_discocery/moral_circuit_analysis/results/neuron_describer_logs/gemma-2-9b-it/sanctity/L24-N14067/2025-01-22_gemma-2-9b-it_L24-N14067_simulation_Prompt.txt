Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron (layer 24, index 14067) is primarily responsive to discussions and narratives centered around human rights, fundamental freedoms, and societal principles that emphasize moral and ethical duties. The new evidence provides further clarity on the specific contexts and patterns that trigger the neuron.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in the presence of tokens and phrases related to human rights, personal safety, bodily integrity, and freedom of expression. These elements are often embedded in contexts that advocate for or explain the importance of these concepts within a societal or moral framework.
   - The highest activations occur when the text explicitly connects these concepts to broader societal values or moral imperatives, such as the necessity of upholding these rights for a just and equitable society.

2. **Contextual Sensitivity**:
   - The neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts that frame human rights and freedoms as essential components of a moral society. This includes discussions that highlight the role of these rights in ensuring dignity, respect, and protection from harm.
   - The neuron shows strong activation when the text emphasizes the societal duty to uphold these principles, as seen in phrases like "moral duty to uphold" and "cornerstones of a society that values human rights."

3. **Nuances and New Patterns**:
   - The neuron does not activate as strongly when the context shifts away from a direct moral or societal framework, even if the text still mentions human rights or freedoms."

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
