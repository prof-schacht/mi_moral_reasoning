=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 24, index 14067) appears to respond primarily to concepts related to human rights, fundamental freedoms, and safety, particularly in contexts that underline the importance or necessity of these concepts in a moral or societal framework.

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly in the presence of tokens that relate to human rights, integrity, safety, and freedom. These tokens are often found within contexts that emphasize their significance or as part of definitions or principles.
   - The activation is highest when these tokens are likely part of a narrative or argument endorsing or explaining the importance of respecting fundamental human rights and societal freedoms.
   
2. **Contextual Sensitivity**:
   - The contexts of the activating tokens share a common theme of moral, ethical, or societal principles. For instance:
     - "Body integrity" is associated with avoiding harm, which aligns with notions of personal rights and freedom from violation.
     - "Right" as part of a statement on"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
