Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to linguistic patterns involving social relationships and supportive actions. Let's break down each of the examples to understand the neuron’s activation:

1. **Example with "your"**: The context suggests a supportive action through maintaining privacy for a friend. The possession (your friend’s privacy) signifies a direct connection to personal relationships.
