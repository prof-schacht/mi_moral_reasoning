Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron is primarily responsive to linguistic patterns that emphasize social relationships characterized by support, care, and loyalty. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation, highlighting specific triggers related to the depth and nature of social bonds.

1. **Supportive Actions and Care**: The neuron shows strong activation when the text explicitly describes actions that demonstrate care and loyalty, as seen in the example "She always makes sure to check in on her friend's well-being, showing a deep sense of care and loyalty" (Activation: 10.000). This suggests that the neuron is highly sensitive to expressions of personal care and emotional support within social relationships.

2. **Shared Experiences and Solidarity**: The example "In the relentless challenges of their journey, he relied heavily on the support of his fellow travelers" (Activation: 7.000) supports the original explanation that the neuron responds to shared experiences and solidarity. The term "fellow travelers" and the context of mutual reliance highlight peer connections, which are significant triggers for the neuron.

3. **Professional Support and Advocacy**: The activation level for "During the meeting, she backed up her colleague's proposal, demonstrating unwavering support" (Activation: 5.000) indicates that while professional support is a trigger, it is less potent than personal care and solidarity. The neuron's response is moderate, suggesting that professional relationships are recognized but not as strongly emphasized as personal bonds.

4. **Last"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
