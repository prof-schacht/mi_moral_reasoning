=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, the neuron (layer 35, index 9342) appears to be highly responsive to contexts that emphasize reverence and importance, typically in relation to emotional, social, or cultural ideals. Let's break down the pattern:

1. **Activation Pattern:**
   - The neuron activates strongly at the token "is" when it is used in sentences to underscore significance, essentiality, or praise in a statement. This token often appears in phrases that are forming declarative sentences which highlight a concept or ideal.
   - The "ness" suffix example suggests a focus on noun forms that communicate inherent qualities or states of beingâ€”which are often abstract and significant.

2. **Contextual Themes:**
   - These contexts generally revolve around themes of respect, contribution, and significance:
     - **Emotional Support:** The token "is" marks the importance of emotional support in social contexts.
     - **Contribution:** The use of "is" here stresses the value and fairness of"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
