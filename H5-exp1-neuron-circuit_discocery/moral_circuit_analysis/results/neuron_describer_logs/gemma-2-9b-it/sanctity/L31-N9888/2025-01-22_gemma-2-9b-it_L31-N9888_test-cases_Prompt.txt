=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron's activations seem to indicate a response to verbs or verb-like forms, particularly in the gerund ("-ing") or present participle form. Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

1. **Suffix Focus**: Each token with high activation is related to words ending with "-ing" or involving this suffix directly, either through gerunds or embedded within words (e.g., "ending", "expressing", "ributing").

2. **Function in Context**: The neuron activates in contexts where these words denote an action or state. This implies that the neuron is sensitive to the grammatical role that "-ing" forms often play, such as showing ongoing action or processes in sentences. For example:
   - "ending" functions in phrases like "Extending the same ending" to suggest a process.
   - "expressing" in "Expressing satire" denotes the act of conveying an idea or feeling.
   
3. **Contextual Roles**: The contexts where these tokens"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
