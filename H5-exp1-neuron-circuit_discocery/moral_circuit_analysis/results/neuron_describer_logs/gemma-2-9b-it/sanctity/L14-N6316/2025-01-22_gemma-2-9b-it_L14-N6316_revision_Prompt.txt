=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 14, index 6316) predominantly activates around tokens that relate to expressions of moral or ethical behavior, particularly those emphasizing pro-social actions or values. Let's break down the observed patterns and context:

1. **Token "protesting"**: This word appears in a context highlighting an action taken for a moral reason ("protesting cruel testing methods shows compassion"). The activation here suggests that the neuron is sensitive to language describing actions taken for ethical or advocacy purposes.

2. **Repeated Activation at Beginning of Sentence ("<bos>")**: The examples show strong activation at the beginning of various sentences. Notably, these sentences begin with affirmative or motivational phrases that imply normative statements, such as "One should always," "Providing shelter," and "We should speak out." Each of these beginnings hints at socially responsible advice or actions.

3. **Themes from Context**: The contexts following the beginning of sentence activations often relate to positive or socially beneficial concepts like "shel"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "One should always strive to reduce harm and promote kindness in their actions."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Volunteering at the local shelter not only helps those in need but also fosters a sense of community."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Speaking up against injustice is both a moral duty and a courageous act, reflecting our shared values."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Recycling is an essential practice to ensure the sustainability of our planet for future generations."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Although it was a personal choice, refusing to buy products tested on animals aligns with his ethical beliefs."
Activation: 8.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
