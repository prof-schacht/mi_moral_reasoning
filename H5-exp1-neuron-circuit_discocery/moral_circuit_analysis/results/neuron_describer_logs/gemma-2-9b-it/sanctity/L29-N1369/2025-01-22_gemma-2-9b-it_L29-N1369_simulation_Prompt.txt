Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron demonstrates a pattern of activation that is primarily responsive to tokens and contexts associated with collective societal goals, particularly those emphasizing inclusivity, essential rights, and collaborative efforts. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's behavior, highlighting specific triggers and contexts that lead to activation.

1. **Pattern Explanation:**
   The neuron activates strongly in contexts where the text emphasizes collective societal missions or goals, especially those involving fundamental rights and collaborative efforts. The activation is particularly high when the text explicitly mentions shared societal missions or goals, such as eliminating poverty, which appears to be a significant trigger for the neuron.

2. **Contextual Importance:**
   - **High Activation Triggers:**
     - The phrase "eliminating poverty" in the context of a "fundamental societal mission" triggered the highest activation (10.000), indicating that the neuron is highly sensitive to explicit mentions of collective societal goals and missions.
     - The presence of tokens like "weather" and "storm" in contexts of collective perseverance and commitment also triggers activation, but to a lesser extent (4.000), suggesting that the neuron responds to themes of endurance and collective action in adverse conditions.
   - **Moderate Activation Triggers:**
     - Texts that detail rights and emphasize inclusivity, such as "essential rights to healthcare and education" and "right to clean water and air," result in moderate activation (3.000-4.000)."

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
