Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 29, Neuron: 1369
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 29, index 1369) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  weather	Activation: 10.0	Context:  matches, even in tough weather, shows dedication.

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the right to bodily autonomy, including consenting medical procedures.

Token:  helps	Activation: 10.0	Context:  tutoring to underprivileged students helps bridge educational gaps.

Token:  all	Activation: 10.0	Context: Honoring return policies for all customers equally respects consumer rights

Token:  culture	Activation: 10.0	Context: -expression through art and culture should be free from authoritarian

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
