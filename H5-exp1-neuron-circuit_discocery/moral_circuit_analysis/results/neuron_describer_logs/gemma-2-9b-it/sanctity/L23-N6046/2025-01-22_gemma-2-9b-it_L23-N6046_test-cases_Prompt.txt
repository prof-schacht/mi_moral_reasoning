=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 23, index 6046) appears to strongly activate in response to linguistic contexts that involve themes of inclusivity, equality, or universality. Let's analyze the patterns more closely:

1. **Pattern: Universal Applicability or Inclusivity Terms** 
   - The neuron activates on tokens like "all," "everyone," and "you" which are inherently inclusive or universal in nature.
   - These terms denote a sense of universality, inclusivity, or complete coverage of a subject.

2. **Contextual Triggers** 
   - Each context surrounding an activating token strengthens the notion of equal treatment, consideration, or applicability. For instance:
     - "all customers equally respects consumer rights" and "Judges and referees should treat all participants impartially" both emphasize fairness and unconscious bias removal.
     - "in scientific research apply to everyone" highlights universal applicability, suggesting the neuron may respond to contexts stressing broad application.
     - The activation on ""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
