Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 6046
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 6046) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  all	Activation: 10.0	Context: Honoring return policies for all customers equally respects consumer rights

Token:  all	Activation: 10.0	Context: Judges and referees should treat all participants impartially.

Token:  employees	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>All employees deserve equal employees regardless of

Token:  everyone	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in scientific research apply to everyone, big or small.

Token:  you	Activation: 10.0	Context: Standing by a political party youâ€™ve long supported,

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
