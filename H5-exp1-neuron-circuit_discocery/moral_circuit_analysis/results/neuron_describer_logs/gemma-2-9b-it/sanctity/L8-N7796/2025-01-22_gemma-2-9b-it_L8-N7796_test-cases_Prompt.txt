=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 8, index 7796) seems to activate in contexts that emphasize individual rights, personal autonomy, and respect for intrinsic values, as suggested by the provided examples. Let’s break down how and why this neuron activates:

1. **Token Activation**:
   - The tokens that trigger high activation include words like "make," "of," "methods," and "choose." These are fairly common words, so their high activation must be explained by the specific contexts in which they appear.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - **"make"** in "should have the freedom to make personal choices about their bodies" suggests activation occurs when discussing personal agency and autonomy.
   - **"of"** in "Respecting the sanctity of one’s own body" and "forests, honors the sanctity of nature" indicates a pattern where concepts of respect or sanctity related to personal or intrinsic values are present.
   - **"methods""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
