Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron's activation pattern indicates that it is responsive to linguistic structures related to the theme of "integrity and reliability," particularly in social, corporate, or legal contexts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its behavior:

1. **Keywords of Integrity and Reliability:** The neuron activates strongly at words such as "corporate," "loyalty," and "unwavering." These words signify concepts of steadfastness or trustworthiness. This suggests the neuron is tuned to recognize tokens that directly embody integrity or reliability.

2. **Sense of Honor and Trust:** Activation also occurs strongly in contexts where there is an expression of commitment or fidelity, as seen with "honor" and "loyalty." These words are essential in narratives that emphasize trust and unwavering support, highlighting the neuron's focus on positive, stability-oriented language.

3. **Symbolism and Metaphors:** The neuron activates for symbolic representations of these themes, as evidenced by the activation on "the" and "of" in the context"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
