Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron's activation pattern indicates a strong responsiveness to linguistic structures that convey themes of "integrity and reliability," particularly in contexts involving social, corporate, or legal scenarios. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Keywords of Integrity and Reliability:** The neuron shows strong activation in response to words and phrases that explicitly denote steadfastness and trustworthiness, such as "unwavering commitment," "integrity," and "reliability." The test cases confirm that the neuron is highly sensitive to these direct expressions of integrity, as seen in the high activation scores for sentences containing these terms.

2. **Sense of Honor and Trust:** The neuron also activates robustly in contexts that emphasize commitment and fidelity, such as "loyalty," "honor," and "trust." The test cases reveal that the neuron's activation is particularly pronounced when these concepts are illustrated through actions or narratives, as evidenced by the high activation score of 5.000 in the sentence describing loyalty during a crisis.

3. **Symbolism and Metaphors:** The neuron responds to symbolic representations of integrity and reliability, as seen in the activation for metaphors like "the bridge stood as a metaphor for their unwavering support." This suggests that the neuron is attuned to figurative language that conveys these themes, supporting the original explanation's mention of symbolism.

4. **Contextual Emphasis:** The new evidence highlights that the neuron's"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
