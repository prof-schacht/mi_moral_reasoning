Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 20, index 2115) is primarily responsive to linguistic contexts involving fairness, justice, and equitable distribution, with a particular emphasis on language that underscores balanced or just actions and systems. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron consistently activates on terms like "fair," "proportionally," and "justice," confirming its sensitivity to concepts of equity and justice. These terms frequently appear in contexts discussing fairness or just allocation, reinforcing the neuron's role in detecting thematic language around equitable practices.
   - The activation levels in the test cases suggest that the neuron's response is stronger when these terms are directly associated with actions or systems ensuring equitable treatment or distribution, as seen in phrases like "proportionally distributed" and "fair share."

2. **Contextual Interpretation**:
   - The neuron shows significant activation in contexts where fairness and justice are central themes, such as legal systems ("fair trial," "justice being the guiding principle") and resource allocation ("allocated proportionally," "fairly distribute"). This indicates that the neuron is particularly attuned to contexts where fairness is not just mentioned but is a guiding principle or outcome.
   - The neuron's activation on the word "is" and the symbol "'" is less pronounced in the new evidence, suggesting that its sensitivity to these elements may be more context-dependent, primarily when they contribute to reinforcing a
