=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 20, index 2115) seems to respond to linguistic contexts related to fairness, morality, and equitable distribution, particularly focusing on language that emphasizes just or proportionate actions or systems.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens like "fair" and "proportionally," suggesting a sensitivity to concepts of equity and justice. These terms often appear in discussions about fairness or just allocation, suggesting the neuron's role in detecting thematic language around equitable practices.

2. **Contextual Interpretation**:
   - In the examples, "fair" is used in contexts relating to justice systems and trials, emphasizing fairness as a moral or legal principle. "Proportionally" is associated with equitable distribution, reinforcing the neuron's sensitivity to balanced or fair allocation themes.
   - The neuronâ€™s activation on the word "is" and the symbol "'" implies it might be sensitive to contexts where the sentence structure reinforces a moral or normative statement. For example, "is"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The law was designed to ensure that all citizens are treated fairly, with justice being the guiding principle."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Resources were allocated proportionally to each department, ensuring that each received a fair share based on their needs."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "A fair trial is essential to uphold the principles of justice and equity in our legal system."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Deciding how to fairly distribute the inheritance was challenging, but ultimately everyone agreed it should be divided equally."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The committee emphasized that any increase in taxes must be proportionally distributed to avoid unfair burden on any single group."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
