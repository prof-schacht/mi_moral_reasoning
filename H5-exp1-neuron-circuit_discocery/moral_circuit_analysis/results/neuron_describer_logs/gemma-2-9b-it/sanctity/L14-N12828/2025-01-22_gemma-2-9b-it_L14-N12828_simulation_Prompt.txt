Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 14, index 12828) is primarily responsive to linguistic constructs that involve offering support or assistance, particularly in contexts where the action is directed towards others. The activations can be categorized based on the syntax and semantics present in the context:

1. **Prepositions and Particles**: The neuron shows strong activation for prepositions like "to" when they are used in contexts describing the direction of supportive actions. For example, "offering support to her colleagues" and "offering guidance to those new to the field" both trigger high activations, indicating that the preposition "to" is crucial in specifying the target of the supportive action. The original emphasis on particles such as "ing" is less supported by the new evidence, as the presence of "ing" does not consistently correlate with high activation levels.

2. **Articles and Determiners**: The activation for "a" in contexts like "offering a helping hand" and "offering a ride" suggests that the neuron is sensitive to general and unspecified offers of assistance. This aspect of the original explanation is supported by the new evidence, as the presence of "a" continues to indicate a general offer or action.

3. **Contextual Emphasis on Support and Guidance**: The new evidence highlights that the neuron is particularly responsive to contexts emphasizing the importance or commitment to offering support, as seen in "committed to offering support" and "emphas"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
