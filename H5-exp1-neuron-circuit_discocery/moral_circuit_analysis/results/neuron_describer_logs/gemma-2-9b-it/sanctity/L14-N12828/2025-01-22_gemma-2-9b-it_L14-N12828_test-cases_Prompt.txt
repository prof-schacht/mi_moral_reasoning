=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 14, index 12828) appears to be responsive to specific linguistic constructs involving the offering of support or actions directed towards others. The activations can be categorized based on the syntax and semantics present in the context:

1. **Prepositions and Particles**: The neuron activates strongly for prepositions like "to" and particles such as "ing" in contexts where an action or gesture of support or transfer is described. For example, "Offering support to coworkers" and "Expressing satire oring" suggest engagements in directed actions, where "to" indicates the target of the action or support. The particle "ing" implies an ongoing action, particularly one that modifies or describes the subject performing the supportive or expressive action.

2. **Articles and Determiners**: The activation for "a" occurs in contexts indicating a general and unspecified offer or action, such as "Offering a listening ear" and "Offering a meal." The presence of "a" suggests a"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
