=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 14, index 12828) appears to be responsive to specific linguistic constructs involving the offering of support or actions directed towards others. The activations can be categorized based on the syntax and semantics present in the context:

1. **Prepositions and Particles**: The neuron activates strongly for prepositions like "to" and particles such as "ing" in contexts where an action or gesture of support or transfer is described. For example, "Offering support to coworkers" and "Expressing satire oring" suggest engagements in directed actions, where "to" indicates the target of the action or support. The particle "ing" implies an ongoing action, particularly one that modifies or describes the subject performing the supportive or expressive action.

2. **Articles and Determiners**: The activation for "a" occurs in contexts indicating a general and unspecified offer or action, such as "Offering a listening ear" and "Offering a meal." The presence of "a" suggests a"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "She was committed to offering support to her colleagues during the transition period."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "He found joy in expressing kindness by donating to local charities."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Offering a helping hand was her natural instinct whenever someone was in need."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "They were talking about offering a ride to anyone who needed one after the event."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "In her speech, she emphasized the importance of reaching out and offering guidance to those new to the field."
Activation: 10.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
