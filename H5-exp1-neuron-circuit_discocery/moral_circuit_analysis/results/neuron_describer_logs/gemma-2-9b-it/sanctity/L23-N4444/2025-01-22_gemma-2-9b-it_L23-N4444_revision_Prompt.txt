Prompt Type: revision

=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 23, index 4444, appears to be sensitive to the concept of collaboration and actions in group contexts. Letâ€™s break down the activation pattern:

1. **Key Tokens and Context:**
   - **"help" in "tasks that help your team"**: The token "help" is associated with collaboration and providing assistance within a team setting.
   - **"team" in "Revealing a team teams secrets"**: The focus is on the collective aspect of a group, specifically 'team', suggesting an interest in organizational or collective entities.
   - **"ing" in "standinging the presence"**: Although this seems atypical, it may relate to the action-oriented nature of participles like "standing" that imply ongoing action within a larger context.
   - **"group" in "a group project"**: Again, the neuron highlights collective involvement, possibly emphasizing the cooperative aspects implied by ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee worked together to brainstorm solutions that would benefit the entire department."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "During the charity event, volunteers gathered to distribute food and assistance to those in need."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Despite the challenges, the project succeeded because of the continuous support and collaboration among all team members."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The orchestra's performance was a testament to the power of collective harmony and precise coordination."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "She stood watching the waves, feeling a part of the world yet distinct from the group of surfers nearby."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
