=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 23, index 4444, appears to be sensitive to the concept of collaboration and actions in group contexts. Letâ€™s break down the activation pattern:

1. **Key Tokens and Context:**
