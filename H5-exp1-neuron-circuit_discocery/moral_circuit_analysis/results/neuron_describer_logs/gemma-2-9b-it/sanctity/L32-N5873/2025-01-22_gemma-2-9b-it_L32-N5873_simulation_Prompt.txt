Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron in layer 32, index 5873, activates in response to tokens that are part of phrases conveying themes of protection, fairness, and unity, particularly in sociopolitical and humanitarian contexts. However, the activation is more nuanced than initially described, as it is influenced by the specific context and the role of the token within that context.

1. **Pattern of Activation**: The neuron tends to activate when the token is part of a phrase that implies a positive action or ideal related to justice, protection, or unity. The activation is stronger when the context explicitly involves advocacy or action towards these ideals. For example, the phrase "advocating for the abolition of unjust laws" triggers a high activation (9.000), as it directly relates to protecting rights and upholding justice. Similarly, "ensures equitable distribution of resources" also results in significant activation (5.000), as it promotes fairness and unity.

2. **Contextual Influence**: The neuron's activation is sensitive to the context in which the token appears. The presence of a token alone is insufficient for high activation; the surrounding context must clearly align with themes of positive social action or protection. For instance, "indefinite support to vulnerable groups" results in lower activation (2.000) compared to contexts with more explicit advocacy or justice-related actions. This suggests that the neuron's activation is more pronounced when the context involves active measures or advocacy rather than passive or indefinite"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
