Layer: 32, Neuron: 5873
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 32, index 5873) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  indefinite	Activation: 10.0	Context:  system limits oppressive tactics like indefinite detention without trial.

Token:  social	Activation: 10.0	Context:  taxes honestly supports a fair social structure for all.

Token:  authoritarian	Activation: 10.0	Context:  culture should be free from authoritarian censorship.

Token:  unity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  unfairly criticized fosters strong team unity.

Token:  save	Activation: 10.0	Context: ating blood or organs to save lives is an act of

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
