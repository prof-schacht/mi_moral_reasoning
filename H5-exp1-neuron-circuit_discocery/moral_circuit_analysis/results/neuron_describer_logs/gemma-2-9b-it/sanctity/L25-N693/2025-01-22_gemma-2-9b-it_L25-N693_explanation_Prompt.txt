Layer: 25, Neuron: 693
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 693) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  it	Activation: 10.0	Context: Joining family celebrations even when it’s inconvenient shows devotion

Token:  farm	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Adopting rescued farm farm to protect them from

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  service staff equally respects everyone’s effort.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to ensure a cohesive chain of command.

Token:  social	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Freedom to form social social or associations fosters community

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
