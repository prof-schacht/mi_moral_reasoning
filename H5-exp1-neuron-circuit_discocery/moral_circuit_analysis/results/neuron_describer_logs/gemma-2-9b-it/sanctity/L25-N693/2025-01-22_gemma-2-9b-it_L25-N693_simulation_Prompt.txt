Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 25, index 693) primarily activates in response to patterns involving direct repetition of words or phrases within a sentence. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of its behavior:

1. **Direct Repetition of Words:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation in cases of direct repetition, such as "team team" (activation: 6.000) and "do your best best" (activation: 4.000). This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to consecutive duplicate words, aligning with the original explanation's emphasis on repeated words.

2. **Repetition of Short Phrases:**
   - The neuron also responds to repeated short phrases, as seen in "of of" (activation: 4.000) and "as as" (activation: 3.000). This suggests that the neuron's activation is not limited to single-word repetition but extends to short, repeated phrases, highlighting its role in detecting redundancy.

3. **Redundancy in Common Phrases:**
   - The activation in "end of the end" (activation: 2.000) indicates that the neuron may also respond to redundancy within common phrase structures, though with less intensity compared to direct repetition. This suggests a nuanced sensitivity to redundancy that may not be as strong as with direct word repetition.

4. **Syntax and Conjunction Patterns:**
   - The original explanation's suggestion that the neuron responds to syntax and conjunction patterns"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
