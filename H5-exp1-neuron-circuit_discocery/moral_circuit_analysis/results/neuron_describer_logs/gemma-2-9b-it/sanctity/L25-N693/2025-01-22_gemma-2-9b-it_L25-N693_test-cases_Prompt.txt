=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 25, index 693) appears to activate in response to patterns that involve redundancy or duplication within a sentence. This is evident in the examples provided, where activation occurs in contexts featuring repeated words or variations on repetition:

1. **Repetition of Single Words:** 
   - Examples like "farm farm" and "social social" clearly indicate a pattern of direct repetition, where the same word appears consecutively. The neuron responds strongly to these duplicate sequences.

2. **Syntax and Conjunction Patterns:**
   - In the example with "chain of command," the preposition "of" is part of a common phrase structure. The activation at "of" suggests the neuron may be sensitive to redundant or cliché-like structures, potentially highlighting linguistic connectivity within such expressions.

3. **Article and Determiner Usage:**
   - Activation on the token "it" and a possessive contraction "’" with context like "service staff equally respects everyone’s effort" suggests the neuron"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
