=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 13, index 2536) is likely responding to grammatical and structural patterns within the context of sentences that involve or describe actions, duties, or behaviors with a communal or societal focus. The activation pattern can be broken down as follows:

1. **Pronouns and Conjunctions (Token: "who")**:
   - The neuron activates when "who" is used in a context describing a relationship or supportive action ("a listening ear to someone who feels lonely"). This suggests sensitivity to clauses that attribute an action or characteristic to a person or group.

2. **Definite and Indefinite Articles (Tokens: "a", "the")**:
   - The activation on "a" and "the" within contexts like "Staying true to a [concept]" and "the flag or standing for the national anthem" signifies that the neuron is picking up on the introduction or specification of concepts, objects, or duties that imply a sense of belonging or responsibility."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
