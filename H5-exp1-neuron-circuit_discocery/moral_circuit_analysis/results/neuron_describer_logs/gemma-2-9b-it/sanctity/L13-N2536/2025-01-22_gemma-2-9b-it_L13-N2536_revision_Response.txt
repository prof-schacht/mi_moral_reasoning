Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 13, index 2536) is primarily responsive to grammatical and structural patterns that describe roles, responsibilities, and actions associated with communal or societal contributions. The activation pattern, as evidenced by both the original and new test cases, can be refined as follows:

1. **Pronouns and Conjunctions (Token: "who")**:
   - The neuron consistently activates in contexts where "who" introduces a clause that attributes a role or action to an individual or group, especially when these actions have a communal or supportive focus. This is supported by examples like "someone who dedicates their time" and "a mentor to those who seek guidance," where the focus is on actions benefiting others.

2. **Definite and Indefinite Articles (Tokens: "a", "the")**:
   - The neuron shows activation when "a" and "the" are used to introduce roles or responsibilities that imply a sense of duty or belonging. This is evident in phrases like "the responsibility of raising the flag" and "a leader," where the articles precede nouns that denote significant roles or duties within a community or group.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - The neuron is particularly sensitive to sentences that describe roles or responsibilities, especially those that involve leadership, mentorship, or community service. This is highlighted by high activation in sentences like "She is the one who always volunteers" and "In the role of a leader
