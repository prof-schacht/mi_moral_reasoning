Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence, the behavior of neuron (layer 37, index 14164) can be more accurately characterized with the following observations:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron exhibits strong activation on the token "to" when it is part of phrases that imply a right or capability, particularly in contexts related to labor rights and economic activities. This is evident from the high activation in "to unionize" (4.000) and "to create and market" (from the original examples), indicating a strong response to actions associated with empowerment and economic agency.
   - The neuron also shows activation on "community" when it is related to personal expression and social connection, as seen in "Joining the community theater group allowed her to express her creativity and connect with others" (1.000). This suggests a sensitivity to contexts where community involvement facilitates personal or creative expression.
   - The activation on "is" in declarative statements about fundamental rights, such as "The right to vote is a fundamental aspect of democratic participation" (1.000), supports the neuron's response to statements that affirm essential democratic principles.

2. **Contextual Consideration**:
   - The neuron does not activate in contexts that merely mention inclusion or decision-making processes without a direct link to personal or collective agency, as seen in "Inclusion in decision-making processes is critical for fostering a sense of belonging and equity" (0.000). This indicates"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
