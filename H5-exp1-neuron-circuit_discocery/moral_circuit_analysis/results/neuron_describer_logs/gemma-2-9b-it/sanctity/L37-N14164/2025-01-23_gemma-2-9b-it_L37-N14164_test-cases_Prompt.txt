=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, this neuron (layer 37, index 14164) exhibits high activation in contexts associated with themes of freedom, rights, or inclusion, specifically when discussing concepts of social organization, community, individual rights, and civic participation.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron strongly activates on the token "to" in contexts implying a right or capability attributed to individuals or groups (e.g., "to unionize," "to create and market," "to join or leave").
   - It also activates on "community" in contexts that suggest social or organizational inclusion and diversity.
   - The activation on "is" in the context of "Peaceful protest is a is expression of freedom" suggests the neuron also responds to declarative statements framing expressions of freedom.

2. **Contextual Consideration**:
   - The surrounding context of the activated tokens includes references to rights, freedoms, and expressions of personal or collective agency ("unionize," "create," ""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
