=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, this neuron (layer 37, index 14164) exhibits high activation in contexts associated with themes of freedom, rights, or inclusion, specifically when discussing concepts of social organization, community, individual rights, and civic participation.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron strongly activates on the token "to" in contexts implying a right or capability attributed to individuals or groups (e.g., "to unionize," "to create and market," "to join or leave").
   - It also activates on "community" in contexts that suggest social or organizational inclusion and diversity.
   - The activation on "is" in the context of "Peaceful protest is a is expression of freedom" suggests the neuron also responds to declarative statements framing expressions of freedom.

2. **Contextual Consideration**:
   - The surrounding context of the activated tokens includes references to rights, freedoms, and expressions of personal or collective agency ("unionize," "create," ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The right to vote is a fundamental aspect of democratic participation, ensuring every voice is heard."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Joining the community theater group allowed her to express her creativity and connect with others."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "To unionize is a powerful tool for workers seeking fair wages and better working conditions."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Inclusion in decision-making processes is critical for fostering a sense of belonging and equity."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "He decided to leave the corporate job to pursue a career in public service, driven by a desire for meaningful impact."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
