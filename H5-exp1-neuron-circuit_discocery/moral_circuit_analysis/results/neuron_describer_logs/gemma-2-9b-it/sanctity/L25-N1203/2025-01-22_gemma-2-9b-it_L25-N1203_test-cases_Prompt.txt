=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 25, index 1203) seems to selectively activate in contexts where conjunctions, prepositions, or clause markers appear, often indicating an emphasis on transition or logical connection within a sentence. Let's break down its activation pattern:

1. **Token Activation**:
   - The neuron most strongly activates with the tokens "to" and "re" (presumably as part of a larger token such as "rest").
   - It also activates for punctuation like the period "." in certain contexts.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The neuron activates on "to" in contexts like "Access to unfiltered to is essential" and "Access to free press to essential for." Here "to" indicates a direction or relationship, emphasizing necessity or connectivity.
   - Activation for "re" in "to rest when they're ill helps prevent further harm" and "when theyâ€™re unfairly criticized fosters strong team" suggests a response to words that imply purpose or reasoning ("re"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
