=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 25, index 1203) seems to selectively activate in contexts where conjunctions, prepositions, or clause markers appear, often indicating an emphasis on transition or logical connection within a sentence. Let's break down its activation pattern:

1. **Token Activation**:
   - The neuron most strongly activates with the tokens "to" and "re" (presumably as part of a larger token such as "rest").
   - It also activates for punctuation like the period "." in certain contexts.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The neuron activates on "to" in contexts like "Access to unfiltered to is essential" and "Access to free press to essential for." Here "to" indicates a direction or relationship, emphasizing necessity or connectivity.
   - Activation for "re" in "to rest when they're ill helps prevent further harm" and "when theyâ€™re unfairly criticized fosters strong team" suggests a response to words that imply purpose or reasoning ("re"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The ability to adapt to new environments is crucial for survival."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "She moved to Paris to explore new opportunities and cultures."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In response to the allegations, the company promised transparency to regain trust."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "He went to the store to buy groceries, but it was closed."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The project, which is expected to bring significant revenue, was approved unanimously."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
