Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 25, index 1203) appears to activate in contexts where the word "to" is used, particularly when it indicates purpose, direction, or a logical connection within a sentence. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of its activation patterns:

1. **Token Activation**:
   - The neuron consistently activates with the token "to," especially when it is part of a phrase indicating purpose or direction. The activation is strong across various contexts, as seen in sentences like "The ability to adapt to new environments is crucial for survival" and "She moved to Paris to explore new opportunities and cultures."
   - The activation for "re" mentioned in the original explanation is not supported by the new evidence and should be reconsidered or removed, as no examples with "re" were provided in the test cases.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The neuron shows high activation when "to" is used in contexts that suggest a purpose or goal, as in "He went to the store to buy groceries, but it was closed." This aligns with the original explanation that "to" indicates a direction or relationship.
   - The activation is notably higher in contexts where "to" is part of a more complex logical or causal structure, such as "In response to the allegations, the company promised transparency to regain trust," which had an activation of 9.000. This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to "to"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
