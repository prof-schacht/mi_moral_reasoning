Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 19, index 8658) appears to be sensitive to contexts involving ethical principles and guiding values, but with a more nuanced pattern than initially described. The new evidence suggests the following refined understanding of the neuron's activation triggers:

1. **Core Ethical Principles**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where core ethical principles are explicitly stated, such as "honesty," "fairness," "integrity," and "respect." However, the activation is not as high as initially thought when these principles are embedded within more complex sentences or when they are part of a broader discussion. For example, the activation is moderate (5.000) when "integrity and respect" are mentioned as guiding principles, indicating that while these concepts are relevant, the neuron's response is not solely dependent on their presence.

2. **Conjunctions and Ethical Contexts**: The original explanation suggested strong activation at conjunctions linking ethical concepts, but the new evidence shows that the activation is moderate (3.000) in such contexts. This suggests that while the neuron is sensitive to the formulation of ethical stances, the presence of conjunctions like "and" or "while" does not trigger the neuron as strongly as the presence of explicit ethical principles.

3. **Balancing Ethical Considerations**: The neuron activates moderately (3.000) in contexts where ethical standards are balanced with other considerations, such as innovation or freedom of speech"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
