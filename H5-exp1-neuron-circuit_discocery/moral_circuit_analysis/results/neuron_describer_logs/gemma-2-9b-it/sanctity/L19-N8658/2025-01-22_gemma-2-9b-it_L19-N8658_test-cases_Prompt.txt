=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 19, index 8658) demonstrates a pattern of activation in contexts related to the articulation and expression of ethical principles or guiding values. Let's analyze each activation example to understand this neuron's trigger pattern:

1. **Token: .** Activation: 10.0 Context: "principle of honesty and fairness."
   - The neuron activates strongly at the end of a sentence that expresses core ethical principles. The presence of words like "honesty" and "fairness" suggests an emphasis on moral or ethical guidelines. The period likely marks the completion of an assertion of these principles.

2. **Token: and** Activation: 10.0 Context: "should be free to create and market innovative products without excessive"
   - The activation occurs at a conjunction that connects clauses relating to individual freedom with potential ethical constraints ('without excessive'). Here, the neuron might be detecting the formulation of a balanced ethical stance or guidance, emphasizing a moral boundary without hindrance."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
