Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron (layer 13, index 12261) appears to activate in response to tokens within contexts that deal with themes of responsibility, fairness, or maintaining standards. Let's break down the activation pattern:

1. **Concept Activation:**
   - The neuron shows high activation with words associated with ethical or organizational principles such as "abuse," "they," "lives," "their," and "order." These words are contextual anchors in sentences talking about moral responsibilities or systemic structures.

2. **Contextual Themes:**
   - **Responsibility and Regulation:** The activation in cases like "abuse" and "order" often involves a context of duty or control, implying either the requirement to act responsibly or maintain certain standards.
   - **Social Equitability and Protection:** Tokens like "they" and "their" appear in contexts suggesting equality or fairness, emphasizing consistent treatment or protection under rules or laws.
   - **Safety and Preservation:** The word"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: The company implemented new guidelines to prevent abuse in the workplace, ensuring all employees understood their responsibilities.
Activation: 8.000
Text: They were committed to maintaining order during the event, providing adequate security to ensure everyone's safety.
Activation: 6.000
Text: The organization focused on protecting their rights, emphasizing the importance of fairness and equal treatment for all members.
Activation: 7.000
Text: Despite the challenges, she believed it was her duty to uphold the standards of care expected in her profession.
Activation: 5.000
Text: The committee debated whether their policies were fair and equitable, considering the diverse needs of the community.
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
