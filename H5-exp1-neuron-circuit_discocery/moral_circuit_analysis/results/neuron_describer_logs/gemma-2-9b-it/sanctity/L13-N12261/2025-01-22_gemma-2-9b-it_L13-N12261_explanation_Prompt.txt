Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 13, Neuron: 12261
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 13, index 12261) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  abuse	Activation: 10.0	Context:  responsibility to report and prevent abuse when we see it.

Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  legal protections, even if they are unpopular.

Token:  lives	Activation: 10.0	Context:  officials during natural disasters saves lives.

Token:  their	Activation: 10.0	Context:  same standards, regardless of their status, is true fairness

Token:  order	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by HR to maintain organizational order.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
