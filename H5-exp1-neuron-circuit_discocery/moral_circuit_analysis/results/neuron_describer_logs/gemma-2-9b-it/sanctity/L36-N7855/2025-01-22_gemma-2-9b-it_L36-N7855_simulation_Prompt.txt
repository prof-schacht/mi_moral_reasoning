Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 36, index 7855) activates in response to linguistic patterns that emphasize the importance or necessity of fundamental principles, rights, or societal values. The new evidence provides additional insights into the specific triggers and contexts that lead to activation:

1. **Common Trigger Words**: The original explanation correctly identified "is" as a significant trigger word. The new evidence supports this, as each example contains "is" in a context that emphasizes a fundamental principle or right. However, "get" does not appear in the new test cases, suggesting it may not be as relevant as initially thought.

2. **Contextual Clauses**: The neuron activates in"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
