=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 36, index 7855) appears to strongly activate in response to specific linguistic patterns that involve the presentation of statements or assertions about fundamental principles or rights. Let's analyze the exact pattern that triggers the activation:

1. **Common Trigger Words**: The neuron primarily activates at the occurrence of "is" or "get". These words often indicate the beginning of an affirmation or emphasis on a particular concept's importance or necessity.

2. **Contextual Clauses**: The context surrounding the activated tokens consistently involves statements that express essential or foundational aspects, such as freedom, justice, and societal principles:
   - **Freedom and Rights**: In phrases like "Peaceful protest is a expression of freedom" and "Access to free press is essential for a liberated society," the neuron activates at "is" when the statements affirm critical freedoms or rights.
   - **Justice and Fairness**: The activation is also seen in contexts that discuss fairness or objectivity, as in ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Democracy is the cornerstone of a just society, ensuring everyone's voice is heard."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The right to education is fundamental, allowing individuals to reach their full potential."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In any community, fairness in distribution of resources is crucial for harmony."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The ability to express oneself freely is essential for personal and societal growth."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Access to clean water is a human right, vital for survival and health."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
