Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 36, index 7855) appears to strongly activate in response to specific linguistic patterns that involve the presentation of statements or assertions about fundamental principles or rights. Let's analyze the exact pattern that triggers the activation:

1. **Common Trigger Words**: The neuron primarily activates at the occurrence of "is" or "get". These words often indicate the beginning of an affirmation or emphasis on a particular concept's importance or necessity.

2. **Contextual Clauses**: The context surrounding the activated tokens consistently involves statements that express essential or foundational aspects, such as freedom, justice, and societal principles:
   - **Freedom and Rights**: In phrases like "Peaceful protest is a expression of freedom" and "Access to free press is essential for a liberated society," the neuron activates at "is" when the statements affirm critical freedoms or rights.
   - **Justice and Fairness**: The activation is also seen in contexts that discuss fairness or objectivity, as in ""

    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
