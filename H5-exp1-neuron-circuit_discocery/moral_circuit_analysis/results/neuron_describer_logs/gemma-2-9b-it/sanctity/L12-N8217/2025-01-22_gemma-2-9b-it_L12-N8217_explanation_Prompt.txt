Layer: 12, Neuron: 8217
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 12, index 8217) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  innovative	Activation: 10.0	Context:  free to create and market innovative products without excessive restrictions.

Token:  controversial	Activation: 10.0	Context: Allowing open debate on controversial topics fosters a truly free

Token:  evidence	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>A fair trial where evidence is weighed objectively is the

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  cause you’ve championed for years demonstrates honor and loyalty

Token:  in	Activation: 10.0	Context:  your company’s stance in a crisis demonstrates team loyalty

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
