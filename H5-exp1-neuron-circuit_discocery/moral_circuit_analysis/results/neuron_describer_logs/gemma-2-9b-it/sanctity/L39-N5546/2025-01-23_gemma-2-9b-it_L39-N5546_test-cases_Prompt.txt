=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron in layer 39, index 5546, appears to detect themes related to fundamental rights, democratic principles, and individual freedoms within a linguistic context. Let's break down the pattern based on the examples provided:

1. **High-level Concepts:**
   - The neuron consistently activates in contexts discussing fundamental rights and societal values, particularly those associated with democracy, personal freedoms, and empowerment.
   - It shows a strong response to words denoting rights (e.g., "right"), democratic processes (e.g., "election"), and personal autonomy or empowerment (e.g., "unionize," "body").

2. **Linguistic Triggers:**
   - **Specific Words:** The neuron activates highly on tokens that directly relate to democratic processes and personal or moral rights, such as "election," "unionize," "body," and "right."
   - **Suffixes/Portions of Words:** It is particularly interesting that "ize" as a part of "unionize"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
