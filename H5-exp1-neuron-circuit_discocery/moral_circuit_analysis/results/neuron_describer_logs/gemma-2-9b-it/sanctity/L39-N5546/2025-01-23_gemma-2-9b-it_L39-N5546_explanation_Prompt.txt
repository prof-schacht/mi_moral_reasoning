Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 39, Neuron: 5546
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 39, index 5546) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  water	Activation: 10.0	Context:  free access to safe drinking water is a moral priority.

Token:  election	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Votes in a democratic election must be counted accurately and

Token: ize	Activation: 10.0	Context:  workers the right to unionize protects their freedom in the

Token:  body	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of oneâ€™s own body through healthy practices is virtuous

Token:  right	Activation: 10.0	Context:  personal preferences is a fundamental right.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
