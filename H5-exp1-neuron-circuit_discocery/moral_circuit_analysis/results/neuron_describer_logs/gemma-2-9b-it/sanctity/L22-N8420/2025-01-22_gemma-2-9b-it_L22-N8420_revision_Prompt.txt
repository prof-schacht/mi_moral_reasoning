Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron you've described (layer 22, index 8420) consistently activates in contexts where there's an expression of care, understanding, or support extended towards others, typically in social or workplace environments. Here's a detailed breakdown of the triggering pattern:

1. **Token Type and Context**: The tokens that activate this neuron include "that," "who," "for," and "policy," each appearing in contexts that imply a supportive or considerate action or policy.

2. **Precise Pattern**:
   - **Interpersonal Care**: In examples where "who" activates the neuron, such as "Offering a meal to someone who hasn't eaten" and "a comforting hug to someone whoâ€™s upset," the activation occurs when discussing actions that provide care or support to individuals facing needs or challenges.
   - **Supportive Structures**: The activation on "policy" in "compassionate workplace policy" relates to institutional or organizational frameworks that promote empathy and kindness. Similarly, "for" in the"

    Text: "The initiative provides scholarships for students from underprivileged backgrounds, ensuring they have the same opportunities as others."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "She stayed late at work to help a colleague who was overwhelmed with their workload, demonstrating true teamwork."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "A new company policy was introduced, focusing on mental health support and flexible working hours to help employees balance their personal and professional lives."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "He volunteered at the shelter, offering a warm meal to those who had nowhere else to go."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The project included a section for feedback, allowing community members to voice their concerns and suggestions."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
