Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 22, Neuron: 8420
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 22, index 8420) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  that	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Designing public spaces that that friendly to those with

Token:  who	Activation: 10.0	Context: Offering a meal to someone who hasn't eaten in

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  chain of command is crucial for discipline.

Token:  who	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a comforting hug to someone whoâ€™s upset fosters empathy

Token:  policy	Activation: 10.0	Context:  employees is a compassionate workplace policy.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
