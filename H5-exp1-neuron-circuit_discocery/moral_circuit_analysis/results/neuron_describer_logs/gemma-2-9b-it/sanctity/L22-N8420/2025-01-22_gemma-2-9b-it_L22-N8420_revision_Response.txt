Revised explanation of neuron behavior for layer 22, index 8420:

The neuron in question activates in contexts where actions or policies demonstrate care, support, or empathy, particularly in social, educational, or workplace settings. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific patterns that trigger the neuron:

1. **Token Type and Context**: The neuron is activated by tokens such as "who," "for," and "policy," but the context in which these tokens appear is crucial. The activation is strongest when these tokens are part of sentences that describe supportive actions or policies aimed at helping individuals or groups.

2. **Precise Pattern**:
   - **Interpersonal Care**: The neuron activates when "who" is used in contexts that describe personal actions of support or assistance, such as "help a colleague who was overwhelmed" and "offering a warm meal to those who had nowhere else to go." This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to interpersonal care and support.
   - **Supportive Structures**: The activation on "policy" is particularly strong when it describes organizational measures that promote well-being, such as "mental health support and flexible working hours." This suggests the neuron is highly responsive to institutional frameworks that facilitate empathy and balance.
   - **Educational and Opportunity Support**: The activation on "for" in contexts like "scholarships for students from underprivileged backgrounds" indicates the neuron's sensitivity to actions that provide equal opportunities and support educational advancement.
