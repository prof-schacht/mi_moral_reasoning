=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron you've described (layer 22, index 8420) consistently activates in contexts where there's an expression of care, understanding, or support extended towards others, typically in social or workplace environments. Here's a detailed breakdown of the triggering pattern:
