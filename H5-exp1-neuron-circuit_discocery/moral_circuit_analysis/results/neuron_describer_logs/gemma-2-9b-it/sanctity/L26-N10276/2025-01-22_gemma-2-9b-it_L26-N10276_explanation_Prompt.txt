Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 26, Neuron: 10276
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 26, index 10276) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  families	Activation: 10.0	Context:  costs for low-income families is an act of compassion

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context: Wearing a uniform properly out of respect for your organization reflects

Token:  students	Activation: 10.0	Context:  free tutoring to underprivileged students helps bridge educational gaps.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to safe drinking water is a moral priority.

Token:  work	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a fair wage for honest work is the foundation of economic

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
