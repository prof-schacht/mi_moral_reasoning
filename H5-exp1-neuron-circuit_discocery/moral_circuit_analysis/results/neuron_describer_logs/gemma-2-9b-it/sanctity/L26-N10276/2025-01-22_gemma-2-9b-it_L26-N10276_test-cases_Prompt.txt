=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 26, index 10276) appears to be responding to tokens situated within contexts that relate to ethical, justice, or fairness themes, often emphasizing social responsibility and altruistic actions. Here's a breakdown of the patterns triggering activations:

1. **Contexts of Equity and Support**: 
   - Tokens like "families" and "students" are activated highly in contexts that discuss support and assistance, specifically targeting underserved or low-income groups. The context emphasizes compassion and bridging gaps, often focusing on helping those in need.

2. **Expressions of Respect and Moral Duty**:
   - The token "of" in the context about uniform wearing suggests an underlying theme of respect and proper conduct. This points to the neuron's sensitivity to phrases signifying moral duties or communal respect.

3. **Access and Fairness**:
   - Tokens like "a" in context related to access to safe drinking water underlie a narrative of basic human rights and prioritize fairness in resource distribution,"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
