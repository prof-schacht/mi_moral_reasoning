Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 19, index 2108 appears to respond to tokens associated with ethical, moral, or normative contexts, particularly those involving structured guidelines, social responsibility, and moral actions. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of its activation patterns:

1. **High Activation on Ethical Guidelines and Scientific Integrity**:
   - **Token: "scientific"** Activation: The neuron shows a strong response when the context involves adherence to rigorous ethical guidelines, particularly in scientific settings. This suggests a heightened sensitivity to contexts where credibility and trust are paramount, as seen in the high activation (10.000) for maintaining ethical standards in research.

2. **Moderate Activation on Moral and Compassionate Actions**:
   - **Token: "compassionate"** Activation: The neuron moderately responds to actions that are morally positive or socially responsible, such as feeding the hungry or providing shelter. This is reflected in the moderate activation (4.000) for acts of compassion, indicating that while these actions are relevant, they do not trigger the neuron as strongly as scientific ethical contexts.

3. **Low Activation on General Ethical Governance and Workplace Conduct**:
   - **Token: "metrics"** and **"code of conduct"** Activation: The neuron shows lower activation (2.000) for contexts involving general ethical governance or workplace conduct, such as implementing metrics for transparency or creating codes of conduct. This suggests that while these concepts are"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
