=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 19, index 2108 seems to respond to tokens that are often associated with concepts of ethical, moral, or normative contexts, particularly those that involve rules, guidelines, or socially responsible behavior. Let's break down its activations for further insight:

1. **High Activation on Clarity and Precision**:
   - **Token: "metrics"** Activation: The activation is high when a term suggests measurable standards or guidelines, which often align with clear, objective assessments within ethical or normative structures.
   - **Token: "scientific"** Activation: The context involves adherence to ethical guidelines, emphasizing the application of structured, disciplined approaches often associated with science and precise operational standards.

2. **High Activation on Moral and Compassionate Actions**:
   - **Token: "compassionate"** Activation: Here, the neuron responds to actions that are inherently ethical or rooted in social responsibility, like feeding the hungry, which is a widely recognized morally positive act.

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
