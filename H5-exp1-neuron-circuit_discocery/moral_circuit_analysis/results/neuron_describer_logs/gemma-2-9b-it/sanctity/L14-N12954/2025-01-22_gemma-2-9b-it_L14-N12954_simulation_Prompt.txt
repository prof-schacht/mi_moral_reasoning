Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron located in layer 14 at index 12954 demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern that is primarily responsive to themes of discipline, adherence, and commitment, particularly in contexts involving structured systems or traditions. The new evidence provides additional insights into the neuron's behavior, allowing for a refined understanding of its activation triggers.

1. **Strong Activation with "Discipline" and Structured Systems:**
   - The neuron shows high activation (6.000) in contexts where "discipline" is associated with structured environments, such as "The academy instills a strong sense of discipline in its cadets." This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to themes of structure and order, particularly where rules and codes of conduct are emphasized.

2. **Activation with Cultural and Traditional Adherence:**
   - The neuron also activates significantly (5.000) in contexts like "By observing ancient rituals, the tribe maintains its cultural identity," indicating a strong response to themes of cultural adherence and the maintenance of traditions. This suggests that the neuron's sensitivity extends beyond just ethical or disciplined behavior to include cultural and traditional adherence.

3. **Moderate Activation with Ethical Standards and Commitment:**
   - The activation level is lower (2.000) in contexts such as "The board's decision to implement new guidelines reflects their commitment to upholding ethical standards." This indicates that while the neuron does respond to themes of ethical commitment, it is less sensitive to abstract or organizational contexts"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
