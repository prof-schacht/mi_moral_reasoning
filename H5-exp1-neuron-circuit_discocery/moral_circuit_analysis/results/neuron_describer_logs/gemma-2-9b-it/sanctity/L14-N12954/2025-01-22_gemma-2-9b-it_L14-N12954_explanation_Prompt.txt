Layer: 14, Neuron: 12954
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 14, index 12954) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  discipline	Activation: 10.0	Context:  chain of command upholds discipline.

Token:  some	Activation: 10.0	Context: Observing fasting traditions in some religions reflects a commitment to

Token:  discipline	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of command is crucial for discipline.

Token:  word	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>People should keep their word in business deals to maintain

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context: , even in tough weather, shows dedication.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
