=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located in layer 10 with index 8226, appears to respond to concepts related to societal norms and moral principles, which are typically associated with proper behavior or moral conduct.

### Activation Pattern Analysis:

1. **Token-Specific Activations**:
   - **"hibit" in "Prohibiting"**: This token suggests the enforcement or implementation of rules against certain actions. The context refers to preventing inappropriate behavior ("vulgarhibit"), indicating a focus on maintaining order or decorum.
   - **"for" in "hygiene and cleanliness"**: This activation highlights the importance of personal values like hygiene and respect, which are often considered moral virtues or societal expectations.
   - **"and" in "honesty and fairness"**: The conjunction "and" connects two moral principles, suggesting an emphasis on ethical standards that are to be upheld.
   - **"to" in "submitting to lawful search"**: This suggests voluntary"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The new policy strictly prohibits smoking in public areas to uphold health and safety standards."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Teaching children the importance of honesty and fairness is crucial for their moral development."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The company enforces hygiene practices to maintain a clean and healthy work environment."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Volunteers must submit to a background check to ensure the safety of the community."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "It's essential for leaders to demonstrate integrity and accountability in their actions."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
