=== RESPONSE ===

Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question, located in layer 10 with index 8226, appears to respond to concepts related to the enforcement and adherence to societal norms, rules, and safety standards, particularly in contexts that emphasize compliance and regulation.

### Revised Activation Pattern Analysis:

1. **Token-Specific Activations**:
   - **"prohibits" in "The new policy strictly prohibits smoking in public areas"**: This token strongly activates the neuron, indicating a focus on the enforcement of rules and regulations designed to maintain public order and safety. This aligns with the original explanation's emphasis on maintaining order but highlights a stronger response to explicit prohibitions.
