Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question, located in layer 10 with index 8226, appears to respond to concepts related to the enforcement and adherence to societal norms, rules, and safety standards, particularly in contexts that emphasize compliance and regulation.

### Revised Activation Pattern Analysis:

1. **Token-Specific Activations**:
   - **"prohibits" in "The new policy strictly prohibits smoking in public areas"**: This token strongly activates the neuron, indicating a focus on the enforcement of rules and regulations designed to maintain public order and safety. This aligns with the original explanation's emphasis on maintaining order but highlights a stronger response to explicit prohibitions.
   - **"honesty and fairness" in "Teaching children the importance of honesty and fairness"**: The neuron activates significantly, suggesting a continued sensitivity to moral principles and ethical standards, supporting the original explanation's focus on societal norms.
   - **"hygiene practices" in "The company enforces hygiene practices"**: The moderate activation suggests that while hygiene is relevant, the neuron's response is more pronounced when hygiene is linked to broader regulatory or safety contexts.
   - **"submit to a background check" in "Volunteers must submit to a background check"**: This triggers a strong activation, indicating a focus on compliance with procedures that ensure community safety, reinforcing the neuron's association with regulatory compliance.
   - **"integrity and accountability" in "It's essential for leaders to"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
