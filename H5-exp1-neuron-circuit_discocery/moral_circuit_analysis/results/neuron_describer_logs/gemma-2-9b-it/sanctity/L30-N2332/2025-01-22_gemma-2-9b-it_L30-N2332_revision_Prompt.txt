=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, the neuron (layer 30, index 2332) appears to respond strongly to contexts where the concepts of ownership, autonomy, and specificity are present in relation to the semantics of the sentence. Let's break this down in more detail:

1. **Strong Activation with "own" and High Activation Context:**
   - In the example "ing people to form their own community groups affirms local autonomy," the activation occurs at the word "own," which directly relates to the concept of personal possession or self-governance. This word is pivotal in expressing individuality or control within the context, both concepts strongly tied to notions of autonomy or localized control.

2. **Strong Activation with "the" and Context of Aid or Specificity:**
   - The example "One should always come to the aid of a stranger in" shows activation with "the." Here, the context suggests a specific guideline or policy, further emphasizing a universal principle involving help and responsibility, a core"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Her decision to start her own business was a testament to her desire for autonomy."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The committee emphasized the importance of respecting each individual's own opinion during the discussions."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "They were entitled to manage their own resources, reflecting a broader principle of self-governance."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "One should respect the personal space of others, acknowledging their autonomy and ownership over their environment."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The company decided to implement its own set of rules, separate from the industry standards."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
