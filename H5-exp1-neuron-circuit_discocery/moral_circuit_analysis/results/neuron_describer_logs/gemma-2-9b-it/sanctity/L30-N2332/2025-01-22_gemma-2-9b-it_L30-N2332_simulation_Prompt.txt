Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence, the behavior of the neuron (layer 30, index 2332) appears to be more nuanced than initially described. The neuron does not consistently respond to the concepts of ownership, autonomy, and specificity as previously thought. Here is a revised breakdown:

1. **Activation with "own" and Context of Individual Opinion:**
   - The new evidence shows strong activation in the sentence "The committee emphasized the importance of respecting each individual's own opinion during the discussions." This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts where "own" is linked to individual opinions or perspectives, rather than general concepts of ownership or autonomy.

2. **Lack of Activation with "own" in Business and Resource Contexts:**
   - Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate in contexts where "own" is associated with business ownership or resource management, as seen in "Her decision to start her own business was a testament to her desire for autonomy" and "They were entitled to manage their own resources, reflecting a broader principle of self-governance." This indicates that the neuron does not respond to ownership or autonomy in economic or resource-related contexts.

3. **Lack of Activation with "the" and Context of Rules or Space:**
   - The neuron does not activate in sentences like "The company decided to implement its own set of rules, separate from the industry standards" and "One should respect the personal space of others"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
