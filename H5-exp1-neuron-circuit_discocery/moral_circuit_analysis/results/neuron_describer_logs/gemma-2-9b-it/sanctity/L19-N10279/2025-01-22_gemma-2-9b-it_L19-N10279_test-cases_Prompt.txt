=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 19, index 10279) is strongly activated by tokens that are associated with themes of empathy, fairness, and communication, particularly in contexts that involve behaviors or concepts related to positive social interactions. Let's break down the activation examples to identify the specific pattern that triggers this neuron's activation:

1. **Kindly** - In the context "Responding kindly when someone kindly an honest," the activation on "kindly" suggests sensitivity to acts of kindness, politeness, or empathy in social interactions.

2. **Service** - In "Distributing tips among service staff equally respects everyone," the focus on "service" is relevant in the context of fair treatment and respect, especially in service roles. The neuron may be picking up on notions of fairness and appropriate social conduct.

3. **Speak** - The context "We should speak out speak bullying to protect" reflects advocacy or communication against negative social behavior (bullying). The neuron's activation at "speak"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
