Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron is primarily detecting expressions of ethical commitment, moral integrity, and social responsibility. The activations are particularly strong when the text explicitly highlights actions or decisions that reflect these values. Let's refine the explanation based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Token: "rather"** - The neuron activates when "rather" is used in contexts where a choice underscores adherence to personal ethics or moral principles. The new evidence supports this, as seen in the example where a decision is made to stand firm on ethical grounds.

2. **Token: "cur"** - The original explanation suggested activation due to social responsibility, which is partially supported. However, the new evidence shows a lower activation level, indicating that while "curbing pollution" reflects ethical action, it may not be as strong a trigger as more direct expressions of moral commitment.

3. **Token: "respect"** - The neuron shows high activation when "respect" is used in contexts emphasizing adherence to values and norms, such as respecting diverse opinions to reach a consensus. This aligns with the original explanation and is strongly supported by the new evidence.

4. **Token: "testament"** - The neuron activates significantly when "testament" is used to describe a life or action that exemplifies integrity or moral principles, as seen in the example of prioritizing honesty. This supports the original explanation and highlights the neuron's sensitivity to explicit acknowledgments of integrity.

5. **New Pattern"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
