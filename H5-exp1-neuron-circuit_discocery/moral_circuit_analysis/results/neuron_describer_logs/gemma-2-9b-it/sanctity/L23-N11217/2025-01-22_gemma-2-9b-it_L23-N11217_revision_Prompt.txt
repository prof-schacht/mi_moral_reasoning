Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be detecting words or phrases associated with elements of integrity, principle, or moral stance within a context. The high activations occur in situations where these concepts are emphasized or exemplified. Let's break it down based on the examples provided:

1. **Token: "rather"** - Activation occurs in a context where a choice is being made that reflects commitment or adherence to values (e.g., resolving disagreements without leaving).

2. **Token: "cur"** - Although the context is incomplete, the reference to "curbing pollution" suggests an action motivated by social responsibility or ethical considerations.

3. **Token: "respect"** - Activation is found in a scenario where adhering to authority or norms (e.g., pilots following air traffic instructions) is key, signaling deference or compliance with established protocols.

4. **Token: "testament"** - Used in the phrase "testament to compassion," indicating that the context likely involves acknowledgment of ethical or moral principles ("

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "She decided, rather than compromise her ethics, to stand firm and voice her concerns about the proposed changes."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The act of recycling, as simple as it is, curbs pollution and reflects a commitment to environmental ethics."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "His life was a testament to integrity, always prioritizing honesty over personal gain."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Respect for the diverse opinions in the room was crucial for reaching a consensus that respected everyone's values."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Opting to volunteer at the shelter, she demonstrated a profound commitment to compassion and social responsibility."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
