Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be detecting words or phrases associated with elements of integrity, principle, or moral stance within a context. The high activations occur in situations where these concepts are emphasized or exemplified. Let's break it down based on the examples provided:

1. **Token: "rather"** - Activation occurs in a context where a choice is being made that reflects commitment or adherence to values (e.g., resolving disagreements without leaving).

2. **Token: "cur"** - Although the context is incomplete, the reference to "curbing pollution" suggests an action motivated by social responsibility or ethical considerations.

3. **Token: "respect"** - Activation is found in a scenario where adhering to authority or norms (e.g., pilots following air traffic instructions) is key, signaling deference or compliance with established protocols.

4. **Token: "testament"** - Used in the phrase "testament to compassion," indicating that the context likely involves acknowledgment of ethical or moral principles ("

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
