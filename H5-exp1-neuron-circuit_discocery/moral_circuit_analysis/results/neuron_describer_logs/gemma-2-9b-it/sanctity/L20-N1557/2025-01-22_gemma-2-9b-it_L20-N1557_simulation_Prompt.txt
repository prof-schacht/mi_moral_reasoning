Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron located in layer 20 at index 1557 demonstrates a strong activation pattern in response to linguistic cues associated with respect, honor, and cultural or formal practices. The new evidence provides further insight into the specific triggers and nuances of this neuron's behavior:

1. **Tokens of Respect and Honor**:
   - The original explanation correctly identified that the neuron activates in response to phrases indicating respect and honor. The new evidence supports this, as seen in examples like "The ambassador's speech was a profound demonstration of honor" and "In many cultures, bowing is considered a fundamental gesture of respect." These examples show that the neuron responds robustly to explicit mentions of respect and honor, particularly when they are tied to cultural practices or formal gestures.

2. **Formal Systems and Traditions**:
   - The original explanation's focus on formal systems is partially supported. The neuron activates in contexts where respect is shown towards formal systems or traditions, such as "adhering to the company's code of conduct" and "the knight's oath." These examples suggest that the neuron is sensitive to contexts where respect is intertwined with adherence to formal codes or traditions, reinforcing the idea of respect within structured systems.

3. **Conceptual Connections to Influence and Morality**:
   - The original explanation's mention of "conceptual connections to influence and morality" was vague and unsupported by examples. The new evidence does not provide clear support for this aspect, suggesting it should"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
