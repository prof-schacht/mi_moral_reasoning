=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located in layer 20 at index 1557, appears to activate strongly in response to linguistic patterns that indicate a contextual theme related to respect, honor, and significant cultural or formal practices. Here's an analysis of the specific patterns that trigger activation:

1. **Tokens of Respect and Honor**:
   - Example: "in" within "is a sign of respect in some cultures."
   - The neuron activates at the word "in," which is part of a phrase indicating cultural respect. This suggests that the neuron may be responding to the broader context of respecting cultural practices or rituals.

2. **Formal Systems and Traditions**:
   - Example: "system" within "demonstrates respect for the judicial system."
   - The activation here ties to a formal institution (the judicial system) that requires reflection on respect and formal adherence to rules or traditions.

3. **Conceptual Connections to Influence and Morality**:
   - Example: "s" within ""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
