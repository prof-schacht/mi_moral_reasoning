Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 20, Neuron: 1557
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 20, index 1557) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  in	Activation: 10.0	Context:  is a sign of respect in some cultures.

Token:  system	Activation: 10.0	Context:  demonstrates respect for the judicial system.

Token: s	Activation: 10.0	Context:  influences helps keep oneâ€™s mind pure.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment.

Token: ations	Activation: 10.0	Context:  important milestones, like graduations or weddings, is a

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
