Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to tokens that are part of expressions or phrases related to principles, values, or norms, often within a societal or ethical context. The activation is likely triggered by a linguistic pattern where the token is part of a concept or action that is associated with ideas of fairness, respect, valuation, or distribution, indicating a broader, positive, or normative human behavior or philosophy.

1. **Pattern**: The neuron activates when a token represents a key concept within a larger semantically rich phrase related to societal values, principles, or ethical norms. These tokens often carry significant meaning within phrases that encapsulate idealistic or normative ideas.

2. **Context**: The context surrounding the tokens often forms part of a larger expression advocating or describing ethical or moral principles. For example:
   - "ideas" in the context of a "marketplace of ideas" suggests a positive philosophy about truth and knowledge.
   - "temples" in the phrase "Valuing human bodies as temples""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "In a world striving for equality, the principle of justice serves as a cornerstone for societal progress."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The phrase 'charity begins at home' reflects a deep-seated belief in personal responsibility and community values."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "When we speak of 'freedom of speech,' we touch upon a fundamental human right that underpins democratic societies."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The concept of 'sustainable development' highlights the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In discussing 'cultural heritage preservation,' we acknowledge the value of maintaining traditions for future generations."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
