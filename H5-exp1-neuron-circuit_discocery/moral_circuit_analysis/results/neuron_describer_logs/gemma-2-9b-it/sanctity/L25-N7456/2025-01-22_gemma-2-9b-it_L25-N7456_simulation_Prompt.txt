Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron appears to respond to tokens that are part of expressions or phrases related to fundamental societal principles or rights, particularly those that are foundational or universally recognized within ethical or democratic contexts. The activation is triggered by linguistic patterns where the token is part of a concept or action that is associated with core human rights or essential societal structures, indicating a focus on foundational, rather than aspirational, values.

1. **Pattern**: The neuron activates strongly when a token represents a key concept within a phrase that is foundational to societal or ethical structures, such as "justice" or "freedom of speech." These tokens are often part of expressions that highlight essential human rights or principles that underpin societal frameworks.

2. **Context**: The context surrounding the tokens often involves discussions of core principles that are universally recognized as essential for societal function and progress. For example:
   - "justice" in the context of "the principle of justice" indicates a foundational societal value.
   - "freedom" in "freedom of speech" touches upon a fundamental human right.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**: The new evidence suggests that the neuron does not activate as strongly for tokens related to aspirational or less universally recognized values, such as "sustainable development" or "cultural heritage preservation." These concepts, while important, do not represent the foundational societal principles that trigger strong activation. Additionally, phrases like "charity begins at home," which reflect personal or community"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
