=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron appears to respond to tokens that are part of expressions or phrases related to principles, values, or norms, often within a societal or ethical context. The activation is likely triggered by a linguistic pattern where the token is part of a concept or action that is associated with ideas of fairness, respect, valuation, or distribution, indicating a broader, positive, or normative human behavior or philosophy.

1. **Pattern**: The neuron activates when a token represents a key concept within a larger semantically rich phrase related to societal values, principles, or ethical norms. These tokens often carry significant meaning within phrases that encapsulate idealistic or normative ideas.

2. **Context**: The context surrounding the tokens often forms part of a larger expression advocating or describing ethical or moral principles. For example:
   - "ideas" in the context of a "marketplace of ideas" suggests a positive philosophy about truth and knowledge.
   - "temples" in the phrase "Valuing human bodies as temples"
