Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 25, Neuron: 7456
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 7456) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  ideas	Activation: 10.0	Context:  allows for a marketplace of ideas where truth can emerge.

Token:  temples	Activation: 10.0	Context: Valuing human bodies as temples by avoiding harmful drug abuse

Token:  need	Activation: 10.0	Context: Distributing resources based on need is more equitable than hoarding

Token:  elders	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Children showing respect to elders fosters social harmony.

Token:  work	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a fair wage for honest work is the foundation of economic

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
