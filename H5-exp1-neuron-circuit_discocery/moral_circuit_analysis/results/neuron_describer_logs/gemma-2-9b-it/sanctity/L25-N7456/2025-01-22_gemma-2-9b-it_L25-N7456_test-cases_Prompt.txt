=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to tokens that are part of expressions or phrases related to principles, values, or norms, often within a societal or ethical context. The activation is likely triggered by a linguistic pattern where the token is part of a concept or action that is associated with ideas of fairness, respect, valuation, or distribution, indicating a broader, positive, or normative human behavior or philosophy.

1. **Pattern**: The neuron activates when a token represents a key concept within a larger semantically rich phrase related to societal values, principles, or ethical norms. These tokens often carry significant meaning within phrases that encapsulate idealistic or normative ideas.

2. **Context**: The context surrounding the tokens often forms part of a larger expression advocating or describing ethical or moral principles. For example:
   - "ideas" in the context of a "marketplace of ideas" suggests a positive philosophy about truth and knowledge.
   - "temples" in the phrase "Valuing human bodies as temples""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
