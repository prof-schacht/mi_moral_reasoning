Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples given, this neuron (layer 28, index 8428) consistently activates in contexts where there is a theme of preservation or maintenance of purity, sanctity, or freedom. The activation is triggered by tokens that relate to the protection or preservation of something deemed valuable or sacred within the context.

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates for tokens associated with possession or condition (e.g., "their", "free") which are part of phrases emphasizing the preservation or protection of an essential quality or state. 
   - Activation also occurs for action verbs (e.g., "protects") that denote the act of safeguarding or maintaining these qualities.

2. **Contextual Considerations**:
   - The surrounding context provides additional clues that reinforce the notion of preservation. For example, contexts like "communal purity," "cultural sanctity," and "freedom in the workplace" suggest that the neuron is attuned to expressions that emphasize maintaining an unspo"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The organization strives to protect cultural sanctity by preserving traditional practices and rituals."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Their mission is to ensure the freedom to express one's beliefs without fear of retribution."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Maintaining a clean environment is crucial to the purity of our natural resources."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The act of safeguarding our historical monuments ensures their continued sanctity and relevance."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "To preserve the integrity of the game, strict rules and fair play are enforced at all levels."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
