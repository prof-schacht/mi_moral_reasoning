Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original explanation and new evidence, the behavior of neuron (layer 28, index 8428) can be refined as follows:

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates strongly for contexts involving the protection or preservation of cultural, historical, or environmental elements. This is evident from high activations in phrases like "protect cultural sanctity" and "safeguarding our historical monuments."
   - It also responds to contexts emphasizing the maintenance of integrity and freedom, as seen in activations for "freedom to express one's beliefs" and "preserve the integrity of the game."

2. **Contextual Considerations**:
   - The neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts that involve the preservation of something deemed valuable or sacred, such as cultural practices, historical relevance, and environmental purity. This is supported by activations in contexts like "cultural sanctity," "historical monuments," and "clean environment."
   - The neuron shows a preference for action-oriented language that involves safeguarding or maintaining these qualities, as indicated by verbs like "protect," "preserve," and "safeguarding."

3. **Nuances and New Patterns**:
   - The neuron does not activate as strongly for general preservation themes without a clear cultural, historical, or environmental focus. For example, while "maintaining a clean environment" triggers activation, it is lower compared to more specific cultural or historical contexts.
   - The presence of specific"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
