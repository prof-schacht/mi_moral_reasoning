=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 11, index 2295 appears to respond to tokens associated with public welfare and societal well-being within specific contexts. Letâ€™s break down the activation pattern using the examples provided:

1. **Token Type**: The neuron consistently activates for nouns related to aspects of public welfare or well-being, such as "health," "security," "testing," "well-being," and "disabilities." These tokens represent concepts that are often associated with societal concerns and support systems.

2. **Contextual Themes**: The context in which these tokens appear consistently pertains to societal or community-oriented actions or states:

   - **Security**: There's an emphasis on "security checkpoints," referencing collective safety measures.
   - **Testing**: The reference to "cruel testing methods" indicates ethical considerations within a social context (animal rights).
   - **Well-being"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
