Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, this neuron seems to be responsive to patterns indicative of long-term or ongoing connections, commitments, or structures. Here's a detailed analysis of when and why the neuron activates:

1. **Token Context and Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly for tokens that are central to phrases describing continuity, relationships, or the structural aspects of a sentence. 
   - These tokens typically appear in contexts where the idea of sustained effort, connection, or influence is emphasized.

2. **Token Analysis:**
   - "friends": Activated in the context of "keeping in touch with childhood friends," which emphasizes long-lasting relationships.
   - "over": Appears in the phrase "over time," indicating duration or continuity.
   - "of": Part of the phrase "sign of enduring loyalty," again highlighting the concept of sustained commitment or connection.
   - "mend": From the phrase "mend bridges," which is an action oriented towards repairing and sustaining relationships.
   - ""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
