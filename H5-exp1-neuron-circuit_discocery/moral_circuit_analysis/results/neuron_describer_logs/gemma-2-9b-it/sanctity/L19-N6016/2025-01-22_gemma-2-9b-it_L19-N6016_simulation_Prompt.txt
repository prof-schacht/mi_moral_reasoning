Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original examples and new evidence, the neuron's behavior can be more accurately characterized as responsive to patterns that emphasize long-term relationships, continuity, and structural commitments. Here is a refined analysis of when and why the neuron activates:

1. **Token Context and Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly for tokens that are central to phrases describing enduring relationships, continuity, or structural commitments. 
   - These tokens often appear in contexts where the idea of sustained effort, connection, or influence is emphasized, but the strength of activation varies depending on specific nuances in the context.

2. **Token Analysis and New Evidence:**
   - **"friends"**: The original explanation is supported, as the neuron activates for contexts like "keeping in touch with childhood friends," highlighting long-lasting relationships.
   - **"over"**: The activation in "over the decades" confirms the neuron's sensitivity to duration and continuity, as seen in the high activation of 8.000.
   - **"of"**: The phrase "of enduring loyalty" aligns with the neuron's response to sustained commitments, but the new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is more nuanced, as seen in the moderate activation for "of trust and cooperation."
   - **"mend"**: The action of "mend bridges" supports the neuron's focus on repairing and sustaining relationships, though this specific token was not tested in the new evidence.
   - **"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
