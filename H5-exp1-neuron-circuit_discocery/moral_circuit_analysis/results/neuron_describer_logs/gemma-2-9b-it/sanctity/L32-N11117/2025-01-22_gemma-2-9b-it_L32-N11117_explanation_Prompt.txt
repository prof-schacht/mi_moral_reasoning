Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 32, index 11117) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  move	Activation: 10.0	Context: Individuals should be free to move and travel without unjust barriers

Token:  friends	Activation: 10.0	Context: Keeping in touch with childhood friends demonstrates a lasting bond.

Token:  mock	Activation: 10.0	Context: ending your community when outsiders mock it is a mark of

Token:  organs	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Donating blood or organs to save lives is an

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
