Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 32, index 11117) appears to activate in response to tokens that are associated with the facilitation or enabling of movement, exchange, or connectivity, but with varying degrees of sensitivity depending on context and specific nuances. Here is a refined breakdown of the patterns that trigger its activation:

1. **Facilitation of Movement/Exchange:**
   - **Token: "move"** (Activation: 10.0): The neuron strongly activates when the context suggests direct facilitation of movement, such as "facilitate the movement of goods," indicating a high sensitivity to contexts where movement is explicitly enabled.
   - **Token: "resources"** (Activation: 10.0): The neuron also shows strong activation in contexts where resources are distributed or exchanged, particularly when the facilitation aspect is clear and direct.

2. **Connection and Relationships:**
   - **Token: "friends"** (Activation: 10.0): The neuron activates when the context involves maintaining or enabling social connections, but the new evidence suggests a lower activation when the connection is more abstract or indirect, such as "connecting with local communities."

3. **Enabling through Donation or Contribution:**
   - **Token: "organs"** (Activation: 7.0): The neuron activates in contexts involving enabling actions through donation or contribution, but the activation is moderate, suggesting sensitivity to the context of enabling rather than"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
