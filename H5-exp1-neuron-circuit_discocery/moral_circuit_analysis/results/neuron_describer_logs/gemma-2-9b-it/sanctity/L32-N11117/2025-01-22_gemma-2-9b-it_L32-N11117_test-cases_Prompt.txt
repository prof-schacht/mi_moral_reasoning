=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 32, index 11117) appears to activate in response to tokens that are associated with the concept of facilitating or enabling movement, exchange, or connectivity. Here is a breakdown of the pattern that triggers its activation:

1. **Facilitation of Movement/Exchange:**
   - **Token: "move"** (Activation: 10.0): The context suggests freedom of movement and travel, indicating facilitation or enabling movement.
   - **Token: "resources"** (Activation: 10.0): In the context of distributing resources, the token implies facilitating the allocation or exchange of goods.

2. **Connection and Relationships:**
   - **Token: "friends"** (Activation: 10.0): The context emphasizes maintaining bonds and connections, suggesting the neuron detects tokens linked to maintaining or enabling social connections.

3. **Enabling through Donation or Contribution:**
   - **Token: "organs"** (Activation:"
