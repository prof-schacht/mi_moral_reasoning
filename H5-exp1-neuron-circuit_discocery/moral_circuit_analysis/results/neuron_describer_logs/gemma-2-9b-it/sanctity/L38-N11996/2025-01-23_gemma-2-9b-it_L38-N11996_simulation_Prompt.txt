Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 38, index 11996, is responsive to linguistic patterns that emphasize the preservation, enhancement, or facilitation of valued concepts, particularly within contexts of support, empowerment, and cultural continuity. The new evidence provides further clarity on the specific triggers and nuances of this neuron's activation:

1. **Enduring Commitment and Advocacy**: The neuron's activation in the phrase "championed for inclusivity and respect" (activation: 4.000) supports the original explanation that it responds to themes of sustained support and advocacy. The presence of words like "championed" and "inclusivity" aligns with the neuron's sensitivity to contexts where positive social values are actively promoted.

2. **Transmission of Traditions and Values**: The neuron shows strong activation in the context of "passed down through generations" (activation: 6.000), as seen in both the family recipe and ancient teachings examples. This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to themes of cultural or familial continuity and respect for heritage. The high activation suggests a particular emphasis on the preservation of cultural identity and wisdom.

3. **Enhancement of Positive Qualities**: The neuron's response to "fostered a more cooperative and empowering culture" (activation: 5.000) indicates its sensitivity to contexts where positive environmental qualities are enhanced through supportive actions. This aligns with the original explanation, highlighting the neuron's focus on empowerment and improvement of social environments.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
