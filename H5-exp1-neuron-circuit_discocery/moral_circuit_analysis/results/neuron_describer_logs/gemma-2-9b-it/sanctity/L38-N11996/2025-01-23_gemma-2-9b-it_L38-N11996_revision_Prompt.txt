Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 38, index 11996, appears to be responsive to linguistic patterns that emphasize the preservation, enhancement, or facilitation of valued concepts, often within a context of respect, support, or empowerment. Let's break down the contextual activations:

1. **Token: "for"** - Activation within the phrase "championed for years," suggests a focus on enduring commitment and advocacy, particularly highlighting the positive connotation of loyalty and honor associated with sustained support.

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
