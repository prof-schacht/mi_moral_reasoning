Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 38, Neuron: 11996
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 38, index 11996) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  cause youâ€™ve championed for years demonstrates honor and loyalty

Token:  down	Activation: 10.0	Context: Upholding traditions passed down through generations respects collective identity

Token:  more	Activation: 10.0	Context:  coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment.

Token:  can	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to those who are anxious can reduce their distress.

Token:  can	Activation: 10.0	Context:  marriage as a sacred union can imbue relationships with reverence

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
