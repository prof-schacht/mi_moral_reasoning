=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the given examples, neuron 8315 in layer 23 seems to respond strongly to tokens that mark the presence of words ending in certain suffixes or grammatical forms that relate to action or state distribution among entities. Here's a breakdown of this neuron's activation pattern:

1. **Word Endings with Specific Suffixes**: The neuron activates for tokens such as 'profits', 'Adhering', 'among', and 'Saluting'. In each instance, the token itself or its surrounding words seem to carry a suffix or imply a completion of an action (e.g., '-ing', '-s', '-uting', or 'among'). This suggests the neuron has a preference for detecting tokens that are parts of gerunds, plural/singular nouns, or other distribution-related endings.

2. **Linguistic Patterns**: The context involves situations where actions are being executed or distributed among multiple entities. Specifically, words like 'proportionally', 'among', and 'respects' indicate"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
