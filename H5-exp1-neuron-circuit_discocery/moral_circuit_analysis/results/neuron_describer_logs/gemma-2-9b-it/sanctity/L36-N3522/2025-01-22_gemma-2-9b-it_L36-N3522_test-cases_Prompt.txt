=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 36, index 3522) appears to activate in the presence of linguistic patterns related to phrases that emphasize values, standards, or desirable qualities within contexts describing behaviors, qualities, or actions that uphold societal or cultural norms.

1. **Precise Activation Pattern**:
   - The neuron seems to focus on tokens that function as part of phrases indicating actions or characteristics supporting positive or valued outcomes or states. Words like "long," "bodily," "shows," and "the" are not inherently meaningful on their own in these examples, but they serve as a part of a phrase, each carrying a connotation of fostering, upholding, or representing something greater or valued when considering the surrounding words.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The context primarily involves:
     - Descriptive actions or conditions that maintain or foster something positive or culturally important (e.g., "long-term trust," "bodily sanctity," "cultural respect").
     -"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
