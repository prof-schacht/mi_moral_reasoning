=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron in question (layer 36, index 3522) appears to activate in the presence of linguistic patterns related to phrases that emphasize values, standards, or desirable qualities within contexts describing behaviors, qualities, or actions that uphold societal or cultural norms.

1. **Precise Activation Pattern**:
   - The neuron seems to focus on tokens that function as part of phrases indicating actions or characteristics supporting positive or valued outcomes or states. Words like "long," "bodily," "shows," and "the" are not inherently meaningful on their own in these examples, but they serve as a part of a phrase, each carrying a connotation of fostering, upholding, or representing something greater or valued when considering the surrounding words.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The context primarily involves:
     - Descriptive actions or conditions that maintain or foster something positive or culturally important (e.g., "long-term trust," "bodily sanctity," "cultural respect").
     -
