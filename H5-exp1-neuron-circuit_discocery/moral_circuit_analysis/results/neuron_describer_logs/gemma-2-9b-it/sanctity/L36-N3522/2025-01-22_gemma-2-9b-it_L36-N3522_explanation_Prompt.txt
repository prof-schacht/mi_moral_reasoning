Layer: 36, Neuron: 3522
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 36, index 3522) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  long	Activation: 10.0	Context: Treating business partners fairly fosters long-term trust.

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  comforting hug to someone who’s upset fosters empathy and

Token:  bodily	Activation: 10.0	Context:  or brandings upholds bodily sanctity.

Token:  shows	Activation: 10.0	Context:  profanity in sacred spaces shows cultural respect.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context: ize protects their freedom in the workplace.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
