Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 36, index 3522) does not activate in response to linguistic patterns related to phrases that emphasize values, standards, or desirable qualities within contexts describing behaviors, qualities, or actions that uphold societal or cultural norms. The new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is not triggered by phrases or contexts that involve positive or culturally significant actions or characteristics, contrary to the original explanation.

1. **Non-Activation Patterns**:
   - The neuron does not respond to tokens or phrases that describe actions or characteristics supporting positive or valued outcomes or states. Despite the presence of phrases like "commitment to preserving natural resources," "pursuit of academic excellence," "fosters intergenerational respect," "integrity in business dealings," and "sense of social responsibility," the neuron remains inactive. This indicates that it does not focus on linguistic patterns associated with fostering, upholding, or representing societal or cultural values.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The context of the test cases involves:
     - Descriptive actions or conditions that are typically associated with maintaining or fostering something positive or culturally important (e.g., environmental sustainability, academic excellence, community support).
   - However, these contexts do not trigger the neuron, suggesting that it is not sensitive to themes of societal or cultural norms or values.

3. **Revised Understanding**:
   - The neuron may be more sensitive to other types of linguistic patterns or contexts not explored"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
