Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 382) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  collective	Activation: 10.0	Context:  search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety.
