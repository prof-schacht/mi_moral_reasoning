Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 19, index 382) appears to respond to linguistic patterns that emphasize collective efforts and shared responsibilities, particularly in contexts related to societal or communal goals. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation triggers:

1. **Collective Efforts and Shared Responsibility**:
   - The neuron strongly activates in contexts where collective action is emphasized, especially when linked to a specific goal or initiative. This is evident in the high activation for phrases like "collective efforts and communal awareness" in the context of protecting endangered species (activation: 7.000).
   - The neuron also responds to phrases that highlight cooperation and shared responsibility, as seen in the activation for "embodying a spirit of cooperation and shared responsibility" (activation: 4.000).

2. **Contextual Relevance to Societal or Communal Goals**:
   - The neuron is more sensitive to contexts that involve a clear societal or communal objective, such as environmental protection or disaster response. This is supported by the activation in the context of "collective resilience and unwavering support" during natural disasters (activation: 3.000).
   - However, the neuron shows lower activation when the context is more general or lacks a specific communal goal, as seen in "working together for a common goal" (activation: 2.000).

3. **Nuances in Activation**:
   - The neuron does not respond as strongly"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
