=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron in question (layer 19, index 382) appears to respond to linguistic patterns that signify cooperative, collective, or relational attributes in a context that implies societal rules, ethics, or shared human experience. Letâ€™s break down the factors triggering these activations:

1. **Relational or Collective Concepts**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly at tokens linked to the idea of collaboration or co-dependence.
