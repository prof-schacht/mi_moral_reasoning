=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 19, index 382) appears to respond to linguistic patterns that signify cooperative, collective, or relational attributes in a context that implies societal rules, ethics, or shared human experience. Letâ€™s break down the factors triggering these activations:

1. **Relational or Collective Concepts**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly at tokens linked to the idea of collaboration or co-dependence. 
   - Examples include "collective" and "shared," both suggesting unity or joint responsibility among people or within a community.

2. **Context of Protection or Support**:
   - The activated contexts often imply safeguarding, maintenance of ethical standards, or oppositions to adversity ("against" in "out against bullying").
   - This suggests the neuron also recognizes contexts where these collective actions or concepts promote a larger positive or protective goal (e.g., "maintains collective safety").

3. **Connecting or Transitional Words**:
   - Tokens like "of" and "and"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
