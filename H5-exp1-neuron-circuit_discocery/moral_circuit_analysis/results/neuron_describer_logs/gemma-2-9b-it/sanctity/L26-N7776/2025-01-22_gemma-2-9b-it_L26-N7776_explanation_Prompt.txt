Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 26, Neuron: 7776
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 26, index 7776) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  consumers	Activation: 10.0	Context:  disclose product information truthfully so consumers can make fair choices.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a friend working abroad is a sign of enduring loyalty.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  air traffic controllersâ€™ instructions to maintain flight safety.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: t eaten in days is a basic human kindness.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  shelters or community centers is a testament to compassion.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
