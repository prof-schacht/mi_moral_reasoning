Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron responds to tokens associated with abstract concepts that carry significant moral, social, or cultural implications. The activation patterns reveal a nuanced sensitivity to the context in which these concepts are presented. Here's a breakdown based on the original and new evidence:

1. **Abstract and Significant Nouns**: The neuron consistently activates for nouns like "identity," "expression," and "nourishment," which are tied to abstract concepts with societal or cultural significance. These words often appear in contexts that emphasize collective values or ethical considerations.

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - **Identity**: The neuron shows strong activation (7.000) when "identity" is discussed in the context of shaping actions and community values, supporting the idea that it responds to themes of collective spirit and continuity.
   - **Market**: Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron shows lower activation (2.000) when "market" is discussed in the context of ethics and integrity. This suggests that while the neuron is sensitive to ethical considerations, the concept of "market" alone does not strongly trigger it unless tied to broader societal themes.
   - **Expression**: High activation (7.000) occurs when "expression" is framed as a cultural dialogue, indicating that the neuron is responsive to discussions about art and its role in challenging social norms.
   - **Nourishment**: The neuron shows the highest activation (8.000) when "nourishment""

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
