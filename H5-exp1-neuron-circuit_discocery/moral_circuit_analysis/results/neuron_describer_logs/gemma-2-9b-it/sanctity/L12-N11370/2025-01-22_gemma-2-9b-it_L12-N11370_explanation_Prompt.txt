Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 12, Neuron: 11370
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 12, index 11370) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  lifestyle can reflect a commitment to purity.

Token:  toward	Activation: 10.0	Context:  children kindness by modeling empathy toward those who suffer.

Token:  with	Activation: 10.0	Context:  inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play safely.

Token:  variety	Activation: 10.0	Context:  from diverse sources fosters cultural variety.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  ideas where truth can emerge.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
