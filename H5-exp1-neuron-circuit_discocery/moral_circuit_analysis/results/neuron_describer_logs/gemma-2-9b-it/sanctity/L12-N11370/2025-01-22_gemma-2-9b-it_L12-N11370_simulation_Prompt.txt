Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question responds to linguistic patterns that emphasize actions or commitments associated with positive societal or personal change, particularly in contexts that imply inclusivity, sustainability, or community support. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific triggers and contexts that activate the neuron.

1. **Prepositional Triggers**: The neuron consistently activates on prepositions such as "to," "toward," and "with," which introduce actions or commitments aimed at positive change. This is evident in phrases like "working toward sustainable energy solutions" and "dedicated to providing educational resources," where the prepositions introduce actions with beneficial societal impacts.

2. **Contextual Support**: The neuron is highly responsive to contexts that describe constructive actions or qualities. The test cases show strong activation in scenarios involving community support and inclusivity, such as "volunteering with local charities" and "providing educational resources to underprivileged communities." These contexts align with the original explanation's emphasis on supportiveness and inclusivity.

3. **Commitment to Positive Change**: The neuron is particularly sensitive to expressions of commitment or dedication to positive outcomes, as seen in "committed to a lifestyle of minimalism" and "engaged in discussions with adversarial nations to promote peace." These examples highlight a focus on sustained efforts toward improvement or resolution.

4. **Positive Outcomes and Societal Impact**: The neuron activates strongly in contexts where actions lead to broader societal"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
