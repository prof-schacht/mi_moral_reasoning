=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 15, index 13228 appears to respond to patterns related to the concept of "supporting or maintaining integrity and fairness in communal or collective contexts." Let's break down the activation patterns based on the examples provided:

1. **Supporting Roles and Unity**: 
   - The activation for "big" and "team" in contexts like "big or small" or "sports team" suggests a pattern of emphasizing support, inclusion, or loyalty regardless of size or status. These activations indicate a concept of reminding or ensuring fairness and support within a group dynamic, whether it be a sports team or a comparison between big and small entities.
   
2. **Service and Fair Distribution**:
   - The activation for "service" occurs in a context about distributing tips among staff, which directly involves communal fairness and respect. This indicates the neuron's sensitivity to fairness or equitable distribution in contexts where collective efforts or contributions (like service staff) are recognized and respected.

3. **Implicit"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
