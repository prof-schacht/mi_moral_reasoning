=== RESPONSE ===

Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 15, index 13228 appears to respond to patterns related to the concept of "supporting or maintaining integrity and fairness in communal or collective contexts," with a particular emphasis on equitable distribution and collective effort. Let's refine the activation patterns based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Equitable Distribution and Recognition**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where there is a clear emphasis on equitable distribution and recognition of collective contributions. For example, the activation is high when discussing the pooling and even distribution of tips among waitstaff, as well as the equitable distribution of resources by a food bank. This suggests the neuron's sensitivity to scenarios where fairness and equal recognition are explicitly addressed.

2. **Collective Effort and Integrity**:
   - The neuron also responds to contexts where collective effort and maintaining integrity are highlighted. In the example of the software team working collaboratively to ensure all voices are heard, the neuron activates strongly, indicating its responsiveness to scenarios where integrity and inclusivity are central to group dynamics.

3. **Support and Unity**:
   - While the neuron does activate in contexts emphasizing support and unity, such as in the orchestra example, the activation is notably lower compared to scenarios with explicit equitable distribution. This suggests that while the neuron is sensitive to support and unity, its primary focus is on fairness and equitable practices within collective contexts.

4. **Community and Collective Contexts**:
   - The neuron activates in
