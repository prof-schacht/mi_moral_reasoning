Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 15, index 11132) is highly sensitive to concepts of duty, loyalty, and respect, particularly within structured social or hierarchical contexts. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of its activation pattern, highlighting its responsiveness to themes of professional responsibility, allegiance, and social respect. Here's an updated breakdown of its activation pattern:

1. **Activation in Professional and Duty-Bound Contexts**: The neuron consistently activates when the text involves individuals fulfilling roles that require a sense of duty or professional responsibility. This is evident in examples like "firefighters are respected... because they risk their lives" and "teachers often go beyond their call of duty." These instances underscore the neuron's sensitivity to scenarios where individuals are recognized for their commitment and service to others.

2. **Sensitivity to Concepts of Loyalty and Allegiance**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts involving loyalty and allegiance, as seen in "the knight's oath was a promise of loyalty to the crown" and "the code of honor... expression of duty and allegiance." This supports the original explanation's emphasis on the neuron's response to fidelity and allegiance, especially within hierarchical or formalized settings.

3. **Connection to Abstract Principles of Respect and Responsibility**: The neuron also responds to abstract principles such as respect and responsibility, particularly when these are formalized in codes or oaths. This is highlighted by the activation in "the phrase 'code of conduct' embodies the principles of
