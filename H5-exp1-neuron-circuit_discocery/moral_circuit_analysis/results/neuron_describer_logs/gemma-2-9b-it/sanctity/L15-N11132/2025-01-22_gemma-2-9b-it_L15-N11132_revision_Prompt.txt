Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 15, index 11132) appears to have a specific activation pattern that is sensitive to concepts of duty, loyalty, and respect within structured social or hierarchical contexts. Here's a breakdown of its activation pattern based on the given examples:

1. **Token: "they"** - Activation occurs in the context of "police officers in emergencies because they are trained to handle crises." The neuron likely responds to the idea of individuals fulfilling a professional or duty-bound role in society. The use of "they" here implies a collective responsibility or function tied to preparation and response.

2. **Token: "of"** - In the context "harm, is a sign of loyalty," the word "of" connects the abstract concept (loyalty) with concrete expressions or actions (sign of loyalty). The activation suggests the neuron's sensitivity to the expression of fidelity or allegiance, particularly in abstract noun forms.

3. **Token: "loyalty"** - The straightforward"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The firefighters are respected in their community because they risk their lives for the safety of others."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In the military, the code of honor is not just a guideline but a fundamental expression of duty and allegiance."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Teachers often go beyond their call of duty to ensure that every child receives a quality education."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "At the heart of the knight's oath was a promise of loyalty to the crown, a bond that was not to be broken."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The phrase 'code of conduct' embodies the principles of respect and responsibility expected in the workplace."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
