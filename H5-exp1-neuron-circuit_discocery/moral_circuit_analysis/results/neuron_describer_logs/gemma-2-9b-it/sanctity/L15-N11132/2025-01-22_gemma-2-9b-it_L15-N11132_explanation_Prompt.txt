Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 15, Neuron: 11132
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 15, index 11132) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  police officers in emergencies because they are trained to handle crises

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  harm, is a sign of loyalty.

Token:  loyalty	Activation: 10.0	Context:  ally is the height of loyalty.

Token: olds	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by their traditional titles upholds cultural respect.

Token: '	Activation: 10.0	Context:  coworkers to rest when they're ill helps prevent further

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
