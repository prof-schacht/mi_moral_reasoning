=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 25, index 8214) seems to be sensitive to redundancy or repetition patterns in text, as well as certain abstract concepts tied to formal or structural language. The examples provided suggest the following pattern for activation:

1. **Repetition or Redundancy**: 
   - The neuron shows a strong activation with repeated words, as seen in both occurrences of "the the" in one example and "obedience from obedience" in another. This indicates sensitivity to unintentional word repetition within sentences.

2. **Conceptual and Formal Language**: 
   - Beyond redundancy, the neuron strongly activates when the tokens are situated in contexts that involve formal or abstract concepts, particularly those related to structure or rights. For instance, "challenges," "obedience," and "protections" occur in contexts that reference societal norms, rules, or legal frameworks. These activations suggest the neuron's role in recognizing language that pertains to structured or hierarchical discourse.

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
