Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron is primarily responsive to tokens associated with moral and societal norms, particularly those emphasizing collective responsibility, ethical obligations, and traditional practices. The activation patterns suggest a nuanced focus on contexts where these themes are highlighted. Here is a refined breakdown of the activation pattern based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Moral and Societal Responsibility**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation for tokens like "emotional" and "cleanliness" when they are framed within contexts of moral duty and societal responsibility. For instance, "emotional support" in the context of community bonds and "cleanliness" in public spaces both trigger high activation (6.000), indicating a focus on communal obligations and ethical considerations.

2. **Traditional and Cultural Practices**:
   - Tokens such as "ceremony" and "tradition" activate the neuron when they are linked to rituals and practices with moral or ethical undertones. The activation for "ceremony" in the context of a harvest festival (5.000) and "tradition" in fasting during holy months (5.000) suggests that the neuron is sensitive to cultural practices that emphasize ethical behavior or spiritual growth.

3. **Empathy and Compassion**:
   - The neuron shows a lower activation (3.000) for tokens related to empathy and compassion, such as "volunteering," when these actions are described as societal values. This indicates that while the neuron does respond to"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
