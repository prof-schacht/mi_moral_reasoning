Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question appears to activate based on linguistic patterns that involve concepts of rights, entitlement, and capability, particularly in contexts where these concepts are expressed as potential or hypothetical scenarios. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation triggers, refining the original explanation.

1. **Pattern Detection:**
   - The neuron strongly activates on phrases that involve hypothetical or conditional expressions of rights or capabilities, particularly those using the modal verb "should" in conjunction with "have" (e.g., "should have the right," "should have been given the opportunity"). This indicates a focus on potential or desired states of entitlement or ability.
   - The presence of "have" alone does not consistently trigger high activation unless it is part of a structure that implies a right or capability in a hypothetical or conditional context.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **"have":** The neuron's activation is closely tied to contexts where "have" is used in conjunction with "should" to express potential rights or capabilities (e.g., "should have the right," "should have the ability"). This suggests the neuron is sensitive to expressions of entitlement or capability that are not merely stated but are framed as desired or necessary.
   - **"championed":** Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate strongly on the word "championed" or related advocacy contexts. The new evidence shows low activation in sentences where "championed" is"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
