Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron (layer 16, index 4543) is primarily responsive to language patterns that involve moral or ethical obligations, particularly when these are expressed through verbs and contextual cues related to duty, responsibility, or ethical principles. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation as follows:

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron's sensitivity to verbs associated with ethical obligations is confirmed. For instance, in the text "She felt compelled to report the incident, acknowledging her moral responsibility to act," the activation is high (4.000), indicating a strong response to the verb "report" in the context of moral responsibility.
   - The presence of contextual cues related to duty and ethical principles continues to trigger the neuron. In "He struggled with the decision, torn between personal desires and the duty to fulfill his promises to the community," the activation is also high (4.000), supporting the neuron's sensitivity to duty-related language.

2. **Modified or Removed Aspects:**
   - The original emphasis on specific tokens like "be" and "the" as significant activators needs adjustment. The new evidence shows that these tokens alone do not consistently trigger high activation unless they are part of a broader context involving ethical or moral discussions. For example, "The obligation to be honest in all transactions is a cornerstone of ethical business practices" has a moderate activation (2.000), suggesting that the presence of "be" is not a primary"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
