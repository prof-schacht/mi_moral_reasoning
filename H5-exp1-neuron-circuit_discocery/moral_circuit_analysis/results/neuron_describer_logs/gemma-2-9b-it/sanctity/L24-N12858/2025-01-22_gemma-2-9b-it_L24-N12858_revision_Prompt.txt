Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron's activations suggest that it is responsive to specific syntactic and grammatical patterns, particularly involving pronouns or function words that serve important relational or positional roles in sentences. Let's break down the examples:

1. **Pronouns ("they", "others") Activation**
    - The neuron consistently activates in contexts involving pronouns like "they" and "others," indicating that it detects situations where these pronouns are used as subjects or objects in a relational or comparative context. In the examples:
        - "they’re tough" and "they’re unfairly criticized" emphasize "they" as central to actions or descriptions.
        - "others disparage them" highlights a relational aspect where "others" acts as a subject involved in a comparative or contrasting action.

2. **Function Words ("of") Activation**
    - Function words such as "of" are triggered in contexts where they serve to connect entities and form complex noun phrases or prepositional phrases. In the context:
        - ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "They always seem to know exactly what to do, even when the situation gets tough."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Others might disagree with the decision, but it was made with the best intentions."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The success of the project depends heavily on the collaboration of all team members."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "She believed that they, more than anyone else, deserved the recognition for their efforts."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The garden of wonders was admired by visitors from all over the world."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
