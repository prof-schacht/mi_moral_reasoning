Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 12858
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 12858) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  at work, even if they’re tough, shows

Token:  others	Activation: 10.0	Context: ’s ideals even when others disparage them is loyal

Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  up for a colleague when they’re unfairly criticized fosters

Token:  eaten	Activation: 10.0	Context:  someone who hasn't eaten in days is a basic

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to choose their own forms of recreation without government approval.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
