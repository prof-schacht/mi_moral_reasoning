Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron's activations indicate that it is responsive to specific syntactic and grammatical patterns, particularly involving pronouns and certain function words that play significant roles in relational or comparative contexts. Let's refine the understanding based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Pronouns Activation**
    - The neuron shows a strong activation in contexts involving pronouns such as "they" and "others," especially when these pronouns are central to actions or descriptions in relational or comparative contexts. This is supported by:
        - "They always seem to know exactly what to do, even when the situation gets tough." (Activation: 2.000)
        - "Others might disagree with the decision, but it was made with the best intentions." (Activation: 5.000)
        - "She believed that they, more than anyone else, deserved the recognition for their efforts." (Activation: 2.000)
    - These examples confirm that the neuron is particularly sensitive to pronouns used as subjects or objects in sentences that emphasize relational dynamics or comparisons.

2. **Function Words Activation**
    - The original explanation suggested that function words like "of" trigger the neuron when they connect entities in complex noun phrases or prepositional phrases. However, the new evidence shows lower activation levels in such contexts:
        - "The success of the project depends heavily on the collaboration of all team members." (Activation: 2.000)
        - "The garden of"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
