=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron's activations suggest that it is responsive to specific syntactic and grammatical patterns, particularly involving pronouns or function words that serve important relational or positional roles in sentences. Let's break down the examples:

1. **Pronouns ("they", "others") Activation**
    - The neuron consistently activates in contexts involving pronouns like "they" and "others," indicating that it detects situations where these pronouns are used as subjects or objects in a relational or comparative context. In the examples:
        - "they’re tough" and "they’re unfairly criticized" emphasize "they" as central to actions or descriptions.
        - "others disparage them" highlights a relational aspect where "others" acts as a subject involved in a comparative or contrasting action.

2. **Function Words ("of") Activation**
    - Function words such as "of" are triggered in contexts where they serve to connect entities and form complex noun phrases or prepositional phrases. In the context:
        - ""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
