=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 15, index 4969 appears to activate in contexts where concepts of integrity, loyalty, and principled behavior are expressed, particularly in situations that demonstrate personal commitment or adherence to values despite challenges.

1. **Precise Activation Pattern:**
   - The neuron activates strongly on tokens such as "personal," "term," "others," "inconvenient," and "bribes." These tokens are likely part of phrases that construct scenarios involving a personal or ethical choice. The activation centers on words that highlight traits of loyalty, integrity, and ethical standards, often in the context of facing hardships or opposition.

2. **Contextual Factors:**
   - The surrounding context often involves sentences showcasing scenarios where a principle is applied or upheld. For instance, "Risking personal safety" suggests a commitment to something greater than oneself, "despite short-term setbacks" implies perseverance, "even when others disparage" indicates resilience in the face of criticism, "even when it"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Despite the inconvenience it caused her, Maria refused the bribe, choosing to maintain her integrity and uphold the company's ethical standards."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "John's loyalty to his team was unwavering, even when others questioned their chances of success."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "She stood by her principles, risking her personal reputation to ensure the truth was revealed."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "Even when it meant facing criticism from peers, he adhered to his values and continued to support his friend's decision."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In an era where many falter, those who choose integrity over convenience are indeed rare."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
