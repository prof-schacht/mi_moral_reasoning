Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 15, index 4969 is primarily activated by contexts that emphasize principled behavior, integrity, and loyalty, particularly when these traits are demonstrated in challenging or inconvenient situations. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the neuron's activation patterns and nuances.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron's activation is indeed linked to scenarios involving ethical choices and personal commitment. The test cases confirm that the neuron responds to contexts where integrity and loyalty are highlighted, especially when these values are upheld despite difficulties or opposition.

2. **Modified Aspects:**
   - While the original explanation suggested strong activation for tokens like "personal," "term," "others," "inconvenient," and "bribes," the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation is more strongly tied to the overall context of principled actions rather than specific tokens. For instance, the highest activation (10.000) occurs in a context emphasizing standing by principles and risking personal reputation, which suggests that the neuron's response is more context-driven than token-specific.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances:**
   - The neuron shows varying levels of activation depending on the intensity and clarity of the principled action described. For example, the highest activation occurs in scenarios where personal risk or sacrifice is explicitly mentioned ("risking her personal reputation"), indicating that the neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts where personal stakes are high.
   - The activation is also influenced"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
