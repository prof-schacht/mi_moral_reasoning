Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 9, index 4) primarily responds to concepts associated with respect, tradition, and societal norms, particularly in contexts where actions or behaviors reflect adherence to cultural or social standards. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's activation patterns as follows:

1. **Respect and Tradition**: The neuron strongly activates in scenarios where actions are explicitly linked to respect for tradition or societal norms. For instance, high activation is observed in contexts like "standing for the national anthem" and "wearing a tie as a gesture of respect," which are clear expressions of traditional respect and decorum.

2. **Cultural and Social Acts**: The neuron's activation is also triggered by behaviors that are culturally or socially significant, such as "greeting elders with a polite bow." These actions are deeply rooted in cultural respect and tradition, aligning with the neuron's sensitivity to societal norms.

3. **Purity and Cleanliness**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts emphasizing cleanliness and organization, such as "maintaining a tidy and organized workspace." This suggests a sensitivity to behaviors that are not only personal ideals but also reflect respect towards others in a shared environment.

4. **Emotional Contexts**: While the neuron does activate in emotional contexts, such as "emotional pride," the activation is notably lower compared to actions directly tied to societal norms and respect. This indicates that while emotional states are relevant, they"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
