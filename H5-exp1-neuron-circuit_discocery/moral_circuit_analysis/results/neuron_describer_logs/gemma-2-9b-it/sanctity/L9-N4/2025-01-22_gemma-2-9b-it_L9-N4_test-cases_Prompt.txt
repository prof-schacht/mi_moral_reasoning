=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 9, index 4) appears to respond to concepts associated with manners, decorum, and symbolic acts that carry societal value. It activates strongly in contexts where there are references to behaviors, conditions, or actions that are often considered expressions of cultural, social, or personal ideals.

Here's a breakdown of the activating patterns:

1. **Contextual Association with Societal Norms**: The neuron seems to activate in contexts where the token relates to actions or qualities that are upheld as standards or ideals by society. For example, "standing for the national anthem" and "maintaining cleanliness" refer to behaviors often associated with respect and community values.

2. **Emotion and Reflection**: The presence of the token "emotional" in contexts like "emotional distress" suggests the neuron's sensitivity to emotional states that are tied to social response and support. The term indicates sensitivity, care, or empathy.

3. **Purity and Cleanliness**: These"
