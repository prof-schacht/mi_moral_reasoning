Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 25, Neuron: 4018
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 4018) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a loss is a sign of basic human compassion.

Token:  ensures	Activation: 10.0	Context:  fairly for a group project ensures everyoneâ€™s effort is

Token:  important	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for mental health issues is important; we should encourage one

Token:  it	Activation: 10.0	Context:  prevent abuse when we see it.

Token:  fundamental	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to personal preferences is a fundamental right.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
