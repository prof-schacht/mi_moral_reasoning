Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 25, index 4018) is primarily activated by contexts that emphasize the recognition and promotion of fundamental human rights, ethics, and important social values or principles. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Recognition of Values and Principles**:
   - The neuron consistently activates in contexts discussing essential social values, such as equality, compassion, and respect for diverse opinions. The activation on phrases like "principle of equality" and "important that we recognize" confirms the neuron's sensitivity to discussions that highlight the recognition and importance of these values.

2. **Ensuring Fairness and Responsibility**:
   - The neuron responds to contexts where actions or principles ensure fairness and justice, as seen in phrases like "ensures that everyone receives fair treatment" and "holding people accountable ensures that justice is fairly administered." This supports the original explanation that the neuron is triggered by discussions around fairness and responsibility in social interactions.

3. **Fundamental Rights**:
   - The activation on "a fundamental right" in contexts such as "freedom to express their thoughts" reaffirms the neuron's sensitivity to discussions about fundamental human rights. This aspect of the original explanation is strongly supported by the new evidence.

4. **Inclusion and Diversity**:
   - A new pattern revealed by the test cases is the neuron's activation in contexts that emphasize inclusion and respect for diverse opinions, as seen in"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
