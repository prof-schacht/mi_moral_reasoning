=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 25, index 4018) shows a pattern of activating in contexts related to fundamental human rights, ethics, and the recognition of important social values or principles. Let's break down the specific triggers:

1. **Recognition of Values and Principles**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens like "of" and "important" in contexts that discuss compassion and mental health. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to discussions around values that are widely recognized as essential or fundamental.

2. **Ensuring Fairness and Responsibility**:
   - The activations on "ensures" and "it" within phrases like "fairly for a group project ensures everyoneâ€™s effort is" and "prevent abuse when we see it" imply that the neuron responds to contexts where an action or principle ensures fairness, responsibility, or justice in social interactions or behaviors.

3. **Fundamental Rights**:
   - The activation on "fundamental" in the context of "a fundamental right" highlights"
