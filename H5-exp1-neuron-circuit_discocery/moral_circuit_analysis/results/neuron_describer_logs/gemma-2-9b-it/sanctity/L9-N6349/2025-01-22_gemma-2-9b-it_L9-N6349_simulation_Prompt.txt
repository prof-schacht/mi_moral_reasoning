Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron (layer 9, index 6349) was initially thought to detect patterns associated with obligation, necessity, or transparency, particularly in contexts involving disclosure, duty, and organizational responsibility. However, new evidence suggests a more nuanced behavior:

1. **High-Obligation Context**:
   - The original explanation suggested that the neuron activates on words like "disclose" and "should," indicating obligation or duty. The new evidence partially supports this, as seen in the activation on "must disclose" in the context of regulatory compliance, which suggests a strong, non-negotiable obligation.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The neuron does not activate on phrases like "should always provide honest feedback" or "duty of the board to disclose," which were expected to trigger it based on the original explanation. This indicates that the neuron is not simply responding to general notions of duty or ethical responsibility.

3. **Specificity to Regulatory or Legal Contexts**:
   - The activation on "must disclose" in the context of complying with regulatory standards suggests that the neuron is specifically sensitive to contexts where there is a legal or formal requirement to disclose information. This implies a focus on formal obligations rather than general ethical duties or norms.

4. **Non-Activation in Ethical or Normative Contexts**:
   - The lack of activation in sentences involving ethical responsibilities or normative suggestions (e.g., "should always provide honest feedback," ""

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
