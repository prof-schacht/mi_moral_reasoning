Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 9, index 6349) appears to be detecting a pattern associated with obligation, necessity, or transparency, as indicated by its activation on tokens related to disclosure, duty, and organizational responsibility. Let's break this down by considering the specifics from the examples provided:

1. **High-Obligation Context**:
   - The neuron activates on words suggesting obligation, such as "disclose" and "should." These words are typically used in contexts implying a duty or responsibility to perform a particular action or uphold a certain standard.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - For "information" within the context of "product information," the activation occurs when the focus is on truthful disclosure, suggesting a duty or obligation to provide accurate information.
   - With "disclose" in "disclose defects," the activation is triggered by the necessity of revealing important information to maintain integrity.
   - The use of "should" in sentences implies an expectation or norm that guides behavior ("

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The company must disclose any potential risks associated with their new medication to comply with regulatory standards."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "You should always provide honest feedback in performance reviews to ensure transparency and fairness."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "It is the duty of the board to disclose any financial irregularities to the shareholders as part of their ethical responsibility."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The organization's policy requires that all team members disclose any conflicts of interest to maintain integrity."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "In this situation, you should weigh the necessity of immediate action against the potential consequences of waiting."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
