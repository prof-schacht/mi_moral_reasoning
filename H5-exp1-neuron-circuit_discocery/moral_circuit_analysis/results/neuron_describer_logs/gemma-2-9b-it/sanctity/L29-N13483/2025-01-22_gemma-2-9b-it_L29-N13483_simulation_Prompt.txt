Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 29, index 13483) appears to respond to linguistic patterns related to roles, involvement, and contributions, but with a more nuanced focus than initially described. The neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts where there is an emphasis on advocacy, protection, or fairness in collaborative or social settings. However, the new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is not as strong in all contexts involving roles or contributions, indicating a more selective pattern.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron does activate in contexts involving social roles and responsibilities, especially those related to advocacy or protection against harmful behaviors, as seen in the example with "bullying."
   - It also responds to contexts involving fairness and contribution in collaborative efforts, as indicated by the activation with "project."

2. **Aspects to Modify or Remove:**
   - The original explanation suggested a strong activation for any context involving roles or contributions. However, the new evidence shows that the neuron's activation is not uniformly high across all such contexts. For instance, phrases like "Volunteering at the animal shelter" and "involvement in organizing the annual charity event" show moderate activation, suggesting that the neuron's response is not solely dependent on the presence of roles or contributions.

3. **New Patterns or Nuances:**
   - The neuron seems to have a stronger response to contexts where there is a direct action or advocacy component, such as "speak out against"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
