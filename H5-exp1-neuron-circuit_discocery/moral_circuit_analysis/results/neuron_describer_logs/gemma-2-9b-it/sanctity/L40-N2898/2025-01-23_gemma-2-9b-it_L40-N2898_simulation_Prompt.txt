Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 40, index 2898) appears to respond to tokens associated with the detection and reporting of societal issues, particularly when these actions are framed in a context of personal responsibility or direct intervention. The neuron does not activate merely in the presence of societal issues or events but rather when there is an emphasis on individual action or response to these issues. Let's break down the pattern and the context in which the neuron activates based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Tokens of Interest**:
   - The neuron was initially thought to activate on tokens like "it," "discrimination," "protest," "bullying," and "ceremonies." However, new evidence suggests that the presence of these tokens alone is insufficient for activation.

2. **Contextual Clues**:
   - **"it" (Activation: 3.000 in "When you witness harassment, it's important to intervene and report it.")**: The neuron activates when "it" is used in a context emphasizing personal intervention and reporting, indicating a focus on individual responsibility in addressing societal issues.
   - **"discrimination" (Activation: 0.000 in "The protest against discrimination drew thousands who demanded equality and justice.")**: Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate merely in the presence of the term "discrimination" unless it is tied to direct action or intervention.
   - **"bullying" (Activation:"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
