=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 40, index 2898) appears to respond to tokens that are associated with societal issues or actions requiring moral or ethical awareness. The neuron activates strongly in contexts that suggest awareness, detection, or addressing of these issues. Let's break down the pattern and the context in which the neuron activates:

1. **Tokens of Interest**: 
   - The neuron activates on "it," "discrimination," "protest," "bullying," and "ceremonies." These tokens represent a mix of pronouns, negative societal issues, and actions/events.

2. **Contextual Clues**:
   - **"it" (Activation: 10.0)**: The activation is high in the context of "prevent abuse when we see it," suggesting the neuron detects pronouns referring to harmful societal issues when coupled with verbs indicating prevention, detection, or response.
   - **"discrimination" (Activation: 10.0)**: This token directly represents a"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
