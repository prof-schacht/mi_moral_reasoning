=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 40, index 2898) appears to respond to tokens that are associated with societal issues or actions requiring moral or ethical awareness. The neuron activates strongly in contexts that suggest awareness, detection, or addressing of these issues. Let's break down the pattern and the context in which the neuron activates:

1. **Tokens of Interest**: 
   - The neuron activates on "it," "discrimination," "protest," "bullying," and "ceremonies." These tokens represent a mix of pronouns, negative societal issues, and actions/events.

2. **Contextual Clues**:
   - **"it" (Activation: 10.0)**: The activation is high in the context of "prevent abuse when we see it," suggesting the neuron detects pronouns referring to harmful societal issues when coupled with verbs indicating prevention, detection, or response.
   - **"discrimination" (Activation: 10.0)**: This token directly represents a"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "We must address bullying in schools before it escalates any further."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The protest against discrimination drew thousands who demanded equality and justice."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "When you witness harassment, it's important to intervene and report it."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The ceremony celebrated those who stood against societal injustices."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Sometimes, it is the subtle forms of discrimination that go unnoticed but need addressing."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
