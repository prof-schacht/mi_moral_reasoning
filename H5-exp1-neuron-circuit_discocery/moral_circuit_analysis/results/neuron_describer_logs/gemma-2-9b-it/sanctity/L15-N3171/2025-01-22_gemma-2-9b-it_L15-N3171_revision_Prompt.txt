=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 15, index 3171, activates in contexts dealing with principles of freedom, autonomy, and agency, especially in legal, social, or political contexts. This neuron appears to respond specifically to linguistic patterns where the concept of choice, permission, or rights is expressed. Let's break down the activation triggers:

1. **Conditional or Permissive Constructs**:
   - Tokens like "if" and "without" are central to conditional or permissive phrases, which often imply freedom of action or decision-making without constraint. The statement like "Freedom to quit a job if working conditions are poor" suggests a conditional choice or right, reflecting personal autonomy.

2. **Rights and Permissions Language**:
   - The token "of" in "protest is a fundamental expression of freedom" indicates possession or association with fundamental rights. Similarly, the use of "vote" in "each have one vote to reflect equality" associates with democratic rights and individual participation"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "If individuals find the current governance oppressive, they have the right to protest and demand change."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Without proper representation, citizens lack the autonomy to influence policies that affect their lives."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The freedom to choose one's career path is a fundamental aspect of personal agency."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Each citizen is granted the right to vote, ensuring their voice is heard in the democratic process."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "If an employee feels undervalued, they have the freedom to negotiate for better conditions or seek opportunities elsewhere."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
