Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

Based on the original explanation and the new evidence from test cases, the neuron's behavior can be refined as follows:

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron indeed activates in contexts related to principles of freedom, autonomy, and agency, particularly in legal, social, or political contexts. This is supported by the high activation in sentences discussing rights to protest and vote, which are core democratic principles.
   - The neuron responds to linguistic patterns expressing rights and permissions, as seen in the activation for phrases like "right to protest" and "right to vote."

2. **Modified or Removed Aspects**:
   - The original emphasis on conditional or permissive constructs (e.g., "if" and "without") as central triggers needs refinement. While these constructs are present in some activating examples, they do not consistently lead to high activation. For instance, "Without proper representation, citizens lack the autonomy..." has a lower activation compared to other examples.
   - The specific mention of tokens like "of" in rights-related phrases should be de-emphasized, as the evidence does not strongly support this as a consistent trigger.

3. **New Patterns or Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows a stronger activation when the context explicitly involves collective rights or democratic processes, such as voting and protesting. This suggests a heightened sensitivity to contexts where individual agency is exercised within a societal framework.
   - The concept of personal agency, such as choosing a"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
