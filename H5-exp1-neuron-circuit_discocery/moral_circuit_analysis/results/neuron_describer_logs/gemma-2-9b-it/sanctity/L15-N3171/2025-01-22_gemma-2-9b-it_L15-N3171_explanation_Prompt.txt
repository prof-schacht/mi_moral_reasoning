Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 15, Neuron: 3171
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 15, index 3171) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  protest is a fundamental expression of freedom.

Token:  without	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to any region they desire without state interference.

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context:  held accountable for breaking promises or contracts.

Token:  if	Activation: 10.0	Context: Freedom to quit a job if working conditions are poor is

Token:  vote	Activation: 10.0	Context:  committee should each have one vote to reflect equality.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
