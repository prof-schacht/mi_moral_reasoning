Layer: 15, Neuron: 3171
Prompt Type: explanation

=== RESPONSE ===

Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 15, index 3171, activates in contexts dealing with principles of freedom, autonomy, and agency, especially in legal, social, or political contexts. This neuron appears to respond specifically to linguistic patterns where the concept of choice, permission, or rights is expressed. Let's break down the activation triggers:

1. **Conditional or Permissive Constructs**:
   - Tokens like "if" and "without" are central to conditional or permissive phrases, which often imply freedom of action or decision-making without constraint. The statement like "Freedom to quit a job if working conditions are poor" suggests a conditional choice or right, reflecting personal autonomy.

2. **Rights and Permissions Language**:
   - The token "of" in "protest is a fundamental expression of freedom" indicates possession or association with fundamental rights. Similarly, the use of "vote" in "each have one vote to reflect equality" associates with democratic rights and individual participation
