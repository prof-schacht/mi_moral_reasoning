=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 15, index 3171, activates in contexts dealing with principles of freedom, autonomy, and agency, especially in legal, social, or political contexts. This neuron appears to respond specifically to linguistic patterns where the concept of choice, permission, or rights is expressed. Let's break down the activation triggers:

1. **Conditional or Permissive Constructs**:
   - Tokens like "if" and "without" are central to conditional or permissive phrases, which often imply freedom of action or decision-making without constraint. The statement like "Freedom to quit a job if working conditions are poor" suggests a conditional choice or right, reflecting personal autonomy.

2. **Rights and Permissions Language**:
   - The token "of" in "protest is a fundamental expression of freedom" indicates possession or association with fundamental rights. Similarly, the use of "vote" in "each have one vote to reflect equality" associates with democratic rights and individual participation"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
