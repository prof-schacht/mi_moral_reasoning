=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 23, index 5963) appears to be responsive to the concept of actions or attributes that denote importance, significance, or reverence. Let's break down the observed pattern based on the examples given:

1. **Individuals**: In the given context ("against bullying to protect vulnerable individuals"), the neuron activates strongly on "individuals," which implies a focus on people who require protection or are considered important due to their vulnerability.

3. **Comma (,)**: The usage of a comma typically signifies a pause or emphasis in writing. The strong activation here ("even in"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
