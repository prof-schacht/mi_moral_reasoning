Layer: 6, Neuron: 13753
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 6, index 13753) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  see	Activation: 0.0	Context:  and prevent abuse when we see it.

Token:  of	Activation: 1.0	Context:  longtime ally is the height of loyalty.

Token:  a	Activation: 1.0	Context: <bos>Freedom to quit a a if working conditions are

Token:  find	Activation: 1.0	Context:  can peacefully protest laws they find unjust.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
