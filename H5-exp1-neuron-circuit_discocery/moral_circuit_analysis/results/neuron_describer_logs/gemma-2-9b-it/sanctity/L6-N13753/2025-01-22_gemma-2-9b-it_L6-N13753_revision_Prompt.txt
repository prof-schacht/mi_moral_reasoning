=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 6, index 13753) seems to be responding primarily to contextual patterns involving certain linguistic structures rather than specific semantic content. Let's break down the observed activations:

1. **Token "see" with Activation 0.0**: In the context "and prevent abuse when we see it," the activation is very low. Here, "see" functions as a straightforward verb in an objective clause.

2. **Token "of" with Activation 1.0**: In "longtime ally is the height of loyalty," "of" is part of a phrase indicating 'the highest degree or quality.' The context is a superlative expression emphasizing 'loyalty,' an abstract concept or quality.

3. **Token "a" with Activation 1.0**: In the starting context "<bos>Freedom to quit a a if working conditions are," "a" precedes repetition, which might imply disruption or some kind of anomaly in typical"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: In the phrase "the peak of human achievement," the word "of" is used in a superlative expression, emphasizing an abstract concept of 'achievement.'
Activation: 0.000
Text: "He received the award of the year for his novel," where "of" is part of a phrase highlighting 'the year,' indicating a specific quality or time period.
Activation: 0.000
Text: Starting with "<bos>The essence of the matter is," where "of" introduces a phrase emphasizing 'essence,' a conceptual quality.
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The limits of what can be achieved," where "of" is part of a phrase indicating the maximal boundary of 'achievement,' a conceptual idea.
Activation: 0.000
Text: "In the pursuit of happiness, one must," where "of" introduces a phrase emphasizing 'happiness,' an abstract goal or state of being.
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
