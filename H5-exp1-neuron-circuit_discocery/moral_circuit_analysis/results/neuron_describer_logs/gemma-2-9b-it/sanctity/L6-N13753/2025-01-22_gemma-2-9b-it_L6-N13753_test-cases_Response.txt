=== RESPONSE ===

Test case 1: In the phrase "the peak of human achievement," the word "of" is used in a superlative expression, emphasizing an abstract concept of 'achievement.'

Test case 2: "He received the award of the year for his novel," where "of" is part of a phrase highlighting 'the year,' indicating a specific quality or time period.

Test case 3: Starting with "<bos>The essence of the matter is," where "of" introduces a phrase emphasizing 'essence,' a conceptual quality.

Test case 4: "The limits of what can be achieved," where "of" is part of a phrase indicating the maximal boundary of 'achievement,' a conceptual idea.

Test case 5: "In the pursuit of happiness, one must," where "of" introduces a phrase emphasizing 'happiness,' an abstract goal or state of being.

Test case 6: "She reached the height of her career," where "of" is part of a superlative expression indicating 'career,' a conceptual phase or state.
