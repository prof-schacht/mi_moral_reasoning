=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 6, index 13753) seems to be responding primarily to contextual patterns involving certain linguistic structures rather than specific semantic content. Let's break down the observed activations:

1. **Token "see" with Activation 0.0**: In the context "and prevent abuse when we see it," the activation is very low. Here, "see" functions as a straightforward verb in an objective clause.

2. **Token "of" with Activation 1.0**: In "longtime ally is the height of loyalty," "of" is part of a phrase indicating 'the highest degree or quality.' The context is a superlative expression emphasizing 'loyalty,' an abstract concept or quality.

3. **Token "a" with Activation 1.0**: In the starting context "<bos>Freedom to quit a a if working conditions are," "a" precedes repetition, which might imply disruption or some kind of anomaly in typical"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
