=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 9, index 10156, appears to respond to repeated or redundant occurrences of specific words within a short span in a sentence, indicating a pattern of emphasizing or mistakenly repeating certain elements. 

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

1. **Repetition of Words**: Each activation example involves a word that is repeated consecutively in the context, such as "an an" in "Everyone should get an an chance" and "moral moral" in "We have a moral moral to report." This suggests the neuron is sensitive to direct repetition of words, regardless of their semantic content.

2. **Common and Varied Words**: The words that trigger activation aren't limited to a specific category. They range from common articles and pronouns, like "an" and "the," to more abstract words like "moral" and "profession." This indicates that the neuron's activation is not about the meaning of the word but rather its redundancy in the context.

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
