Prompt Type: revision

=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located in layer 21 with index 14193, appears to respond to tokens that are semantically tied to notions of neutrality, integrity, or unimpeded conditions, often within contexts involving inherent rights, transparency, or function.

1. **Pattern Trigger**: The neuron activates on tokens that suggest an idea of purity or authenticity. These words often relate to notions of straightforwardness or absence of interference or corruption. For example, "free" suggests unimpeded access, "honest" pertains to truthfulness, and "without" implies the absence of barriers.

2. **Contextual Relationships**: The activation of this neuron is also influenced by the context surrounding the activating token. The examples show contexts that emphasize maintaining an original state, guaranteeing direct access, or ensuring authenticity. These contexts typically involve societal values or fundamental rights, such as "free access to water," "honest market," and "access to the internet without firewalls."

3. **Consistent"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The community ensured free access to the public library, maintaining openness and transparency for all residents."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The journalist was praised for her honest reporting, delivering facts without bias or distortion."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The park is a place where children can play without any restrictions, embracing the essence of freedom and purity."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Access to the internet without censorship is considered a fundamental right in many democratic societies."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The company prides itself on its integrity, guaranteeing that all customer data is handled with the utmost transparency."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
