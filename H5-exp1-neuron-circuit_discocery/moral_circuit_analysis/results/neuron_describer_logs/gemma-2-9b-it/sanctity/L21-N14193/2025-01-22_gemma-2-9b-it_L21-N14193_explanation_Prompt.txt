Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 14193
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 14193) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  free	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Ensuring free access free safe drinking water

Token:  preserves	Activation: 10.0	Context:  sacred times with solemn respect preserves their meaning.

Token:  honest	Activation: 10.0	Context:  product defects to maintain an honest market.

Token:  without	Activation: 10.0	Context:  deserve access to the internet without state-imposed firewalls

Token:  because	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to police officers in emergencies because they are trained to handle

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
