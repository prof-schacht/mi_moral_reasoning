Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron located in layer 21 with index 14193 demonstrates a strong response to tokens and contexts associated with transparency, integrity, and unimpeded access, particularly in scenarios involving societal values and fundamental rights.

1. **Pattern Trigger**: The neuron consistently activates on tokens that convey notions of transparency, integrity, and freedom from interference. The new evidence supports the original observation that words like "free," "honest," and "without" are key triggers. These tokens are often linked to ideas of openness and authenticity, as seen in phrases like "free access," "honest reporting," and "without censorship."

2. **Contextual Relationships**: The neuron's activation is significantly influenced by the surrounding context, particularly when it involves societal values or fundamental rights. The test cases reinforce this by showing high activation in contexts such as "free access to the public library," "honest reporting," and "access to the internet without censorship." These contexts emphasize the maintenance of an original state, direct access, and authenticity, aligning with the neuron's sensitivity to themes of integrity and transparency.

3. **Nuances and New Patterns**: The new evidence reveals that the neuron's activation is particularly strong in contexts that explicitly highlight societal or ethical values, such as transparency in handling customer data or the fundamental right to uncensored internet access. The highest activation (5.000) was observed in a context emphasizing corporate integrity and transparency, suggesting that the neuron is especially responsive"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
