Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron's activation pattern indicates a strong response to language that conveys moral or ethical judgment, particularly when associated with concepts of duty, obligation, and shared beliefs. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific nuances in the neuron's behavior:

1. **Moral and Ethical Concepts**: The neuron consistently activates in response to tokens and phrases that imply moral duties or ethical responsibilities. The test cases show high activation levels when terms like "moral obligation," "sense of duty," and "ethical values" are present, confirming the neuron's sensitivity to language that conveys moral or ethical dimensions.

2. **Contextual Emphasis on Duty or Belief**: The neuron's activation is particularly strong when the context emphasizes a sense of duty or obligation, especially when these are linked to broader cultural or social beliefs. For instance, phrases like "shared belief in the importance of compassion" and "moral duty reflecting ethical values" trigger high activation, suggesting that the neuron is attuned to the evaluative weight of these concepts in a social or moral context.

3. **Specificity in Moral Contexts**: The new evidence reveals that the neuron is more responsive to contexts where moral obligations are explicitly tied to actions or decisions, such as "act of kindness" or "decision to speak out." This suggests that the neuron's activation is not just about the presence of moral language but also about the explicit connection between moral concepts and actions.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
