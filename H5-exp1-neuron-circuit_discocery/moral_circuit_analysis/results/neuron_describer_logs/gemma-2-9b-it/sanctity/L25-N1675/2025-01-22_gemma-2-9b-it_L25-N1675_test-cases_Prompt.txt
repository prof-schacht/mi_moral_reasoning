=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron's activation pattern seems to revolve around the detection of conclusive or emphatic statements, particularly in contexts where ethical or moral considerations are emphasized. Let's break down the activation triggers:

1. **Punctuation and Conjunctions**: 
   - **Periods (.)** and **commas (,)** are present in a number of high activation cases, indicating that this neuron is attentive to the roles these punctuation marks play in sentence structure. The periods often conclude statements of principle or intention, suggesting a focus on definitive assertions.
   - The conjunction "and" appears in contexts that connect ethical or moral principles, suggesting that the neuron's activation is sensitive to the continuation or linking of such concepts.

2. **Contextual Themes**: 
   - In the examples provided, the context frequently involves expressions of respect (e.g., "sanctify nourishment," "honors human dignity") or fairness (e.g., "safely," "objectively, without favoritism"). These are"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
