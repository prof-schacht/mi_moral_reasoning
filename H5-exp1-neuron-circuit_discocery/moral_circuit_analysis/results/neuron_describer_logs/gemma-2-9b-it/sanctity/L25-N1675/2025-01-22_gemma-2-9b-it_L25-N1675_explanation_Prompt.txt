Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 25, Neuron: 1675
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 1675) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  gratitude and sanctify nourishment.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  with disabilities can play safely.

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should evaluate employee performance objectively, without favoritism.

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context: enhancing drugs undermines fair competition and should be penalized.

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context:  burial grounds honors human dignity and sanctity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
