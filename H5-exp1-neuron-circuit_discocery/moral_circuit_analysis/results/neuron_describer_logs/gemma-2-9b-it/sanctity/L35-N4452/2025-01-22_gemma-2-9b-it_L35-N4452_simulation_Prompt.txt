Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in layer 35, index 4452 is primarily responsive to contexts involving formal social settings and the acknowledgment of social norms, particularly those that involve hierarchical or ceremonial interactions. The activation pattern indicates that the neuron is sensitive to linguistic constructions that emphasize the presence of social norms, formality, and respect, especially in contexts where these norms are explicitly recognized or adhered to. Let's break down the examples to understand this further:

1. **Sensitivity to Formal Titles and Honorifics:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation when formal titles or honorifics are used in a context that highlights respect or tradition. For instance, in the sentence "everyone was expected to address the elders by their honorific titles," the neuron's activation is high (4.000), supporting the original explanation that it responds to formal address.

2. **Formal Actions and Gestures:**
   - The neuron is also triggered by actions that denote respect in formal or sacred settings, such as "bow in the presence of the shrine" (activation: 4.000). This supports the original explanation regarding sensitivity to formal actions, although the specific preposition "in" is less relevant than the overall context of the action.

3. **Presence of Social Norms and Hierarchical Contexts:**
   - The highest activation (10.000) occurs in contexts where social norms and hierarchy are strongly emphasized, as seen in "Standing in the room filled with dignitaries"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
