=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 35, index 4452 is highly responsive to contexts involving respect, reverence, or formality in behavior and language. The activation pattern suggests that the neuron is sensitive to linguistic constructions that indicate deference or acknowledgment of social or cultural norms. Let's break down the examples to understand this further:

1. **Token: "titles"**
   - Context: <bos>Using formal titles for titles or community leaders
   - Here, the term "titles" is used in the context of formality, indicating respect towards individuals holding certain positions or roles. The repetition emphasizes the importance of formal address.

2. **Token: "in"**
   - Context: <bos>Bowing or standing in the presence of high-
   - The preposition "in" appears in a phrase likely denoting a formal action (e.g., bowing or standing) that shows respect in specific settings (possibly followed by "officials" or "authority"). The activation is triggered"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "In the ceremony, everyone was expected to address the elders by their honorific titles, a practice deeply rooted in tradition."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The guide instructed us to bow in the presence of the shrine, a gesture of respect towards the sacred."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "When addressing the ambassador, make sure to use the appropriate diplomatic titles and speak with formality."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "In a surprising turn, he casually mentioned the queen's name without any reverence, which was seen as a breach of protocol."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Standing in the room filled with dignitaries, he felt the weight of social norms pressing upon him."
Activation: 10.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
