=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 22, index 9474) appears to be detecting a specific linguistic pattern related to themes of order, regulation, or maintaining a state. The activation examples you provided share common elements that give us insight into what this neuron responds to:

1. **Theme of Preservation or Maintenance**: 
   - Tokens like "maintains" and "maintain" are central to the neuron's response. These words directly relate to the concept of preserving or upholding a certain state or condition, which aligns with the neuron's reactivity to such themes.

2. **Purpose and Functionality**: 
   - Words like "for" in contexts where it's linked to purposeful actions or objectives ("for discipline") suggest the neuron also detects scenarios where actions or structures serve the function of order, regulation, or preservation.

3. **Authority or Power**:
   - The activation with tokens like "power" in the context of limiting authority ("Limiting police power") indicates the"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
