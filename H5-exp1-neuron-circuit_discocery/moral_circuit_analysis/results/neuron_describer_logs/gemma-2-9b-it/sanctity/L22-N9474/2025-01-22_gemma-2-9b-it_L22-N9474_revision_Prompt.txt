Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 22, index 9474) appears to be detecting a specific linguistic pattern related to themes of order, regulation, or maintaining a state. The activation examples you provided share common elements that give us insight into what this neuron responds to:

1. **Theme of Preservation or Maintenance**: 
   - Tokens like "maintains" and "maintain" are central to the neuron's response. These words directly relate to the concept of preserving or upholding a certain state or condition, which aligns with the neuron's reactivity to such themes.

2. **Purpose and Functionality**: 
   - Words like "for" in contexts where it's linked to purposeful actions or objectives ("for discipline") suggest the neuron also detects scenarios where actions or structures serve the function of order, regulation, or preservation.

3. **Authority or Power**:
   - The activation with tokens like "power" in the context of limiting authority ("Limiting police power") indicates the"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee was established to maintain the integrity of the organization's operations."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The ancient ruins are preserved to maintain their historical significance for future generations."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Implementing rules for classroom behavior is crucial for maintaining discipline."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Exercising regularly is essential for maintaining one's health and well-being."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In order to maintain a balance of power, the constitution limits the president's authority."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
