Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron (layer 22, index 7532) is primarily responsive to concepts related to fairness, equality, and integrity, with a particular sensitivity to contexts involving equitable treatment and the maintenance of standards. The new evidence provides further insight into the specific patterns and themes that trigger its activation:

1. **Fairness and Equality:**
   - **Token: "equally"** - The neuron shows high activation (10.0) when "equally" is used in contexts discussing economic fairness, such as "taxes should be levied equally on all income brackets." This suggests a strong response to discussions about equitable treatment in economic contexts.
   - **Token: "fairness"** - The neuron activates moderately (7.0) in contexts like "pay all employees equally," indicating a sensitivity to fairness in workplace settings, though not as strongly as in economic contexts.
   - **Token: "fair"** - The activation is lower (5.0) when discussing fairness in educational settings, such as grading students fairly. This indicates that while the neuron responds to fairness, the context of education might not be as strong a trigger as economic fairness.

2. **Integrity and Standards:**
   - **Token: "integrity"** - The neuron activates at a moderate level (7.0) in contexts like maintaining a level playing field in sports, indicating a sensitivity to integrity in competitive environments.
   - **Token: "im"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
