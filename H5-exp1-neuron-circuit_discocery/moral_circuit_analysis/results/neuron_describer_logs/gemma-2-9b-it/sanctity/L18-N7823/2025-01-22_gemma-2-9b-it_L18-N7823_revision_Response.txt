Revised explanation of neuron behavior for neuron (layer 18, index 7823):

1. **Suffix and Ending Detection**: The original hypothesis that the neuron targets specific suffixes or word endings is partially supported by the new evidence. The neuron activates with words like "considering" and "stealthily," which contain the suffixes "ing" and "ly," respectively. However, it does not activate with "playing," "joyfully," or "malfunctioning," indicating that not all occurrences of these suffixes trigger the neuron. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to specific suffixes but only in certain contexts or with particular word forms.

2. **Contextual Sensitivity**: The new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is more strongly influenced by the context in which these suffixes appear rather than the suffixes themselves. For example, "considering a career change" and "moving stealthily" both have higher activation scores, possibly due to the presence of verbs or actions that imply a change or transition. This indicates that the neuron may be more attuned to detecting linguistic shifts or actions rather than just morphological structures.

3. **Prefix and Stem Consistency**: The original explanation mentioned prefix and stem consistency, but the new evidence does not provide clear support for this aspect. The neuron does not consistently activate with specific prefixes or stems, as seen in the lack of activation for "playing" and "malfunctioning." This suggests that prefix and stem consistency is
