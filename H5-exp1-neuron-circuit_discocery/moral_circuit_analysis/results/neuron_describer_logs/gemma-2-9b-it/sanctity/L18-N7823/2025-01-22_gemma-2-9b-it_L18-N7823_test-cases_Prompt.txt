=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided for neuron (layer 18, index 7823), we can identify the following pattern for its activation:

1. **Suffix and Ending Detection**: The neuron appears to target specific suffixes or word endings. For instance, it activates with "ing" in "standinging" and "ently" in "reverently". The presence of these particular letter groupings at the end of words suggests that the neuron is tuned to detect specific morphological structures.

2. **Contextual Sensitivity**: While the activation examples themselves have very low activation scores, the surrounding context provides a clue that the neuron might weakly respond to linguistic shifts that often accompany the morphological or syntactic structures the suffixes pertain to. For example, "objectively is the" and "veterans honors their" are contexts typical in sentences structured with formal, structured language, which often feature adverbial forms indicated by these suffixes.

3. **Prefix and Stem Consistency**"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
