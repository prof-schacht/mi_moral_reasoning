Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, neuron 6607 in layer 37 demonstrates a nuanced sensitivity to linguistic patterns associated with altruistic actions and community support, but with a more specific focus on direct, tangible acts of compassion and community engagement rather than broader environmental themes.

### Revised Analysis of Activation Patterns:

1. **Direct Acts of Compassion and Community Support**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation when the text describes direct, tangible actions of compassion and community support. This is evident in examples where individuals or groups are actively engaged in helping others or improving community welfare:
     - "worked tirelessly to plant trees" and "distribute meals to the homeless" both received high activations (6.000), indicating a strong response to direct, collective actions aimed at benefiting others or the environment.
     - "donated her old clothes to the community center" also triggered a significant activation (5.000), reinforcing the neuron's sensitivity to personal acts of giving and support.

2. **Environmental and Sustainability Contexts**:
   - The neuron shows moderate activation for actions related to environmental sustainability and ecological respect, but these do not trigger as strong a response as direct acts of compassion:
     - "supports sustainable farming practices" and "organized a recycling drive" both resulted in lower activations (3.000), suggesting that while the neuron recognizes the importance of these actions, they do not elicit as strong a response as more immediate, human-centered acts of kindness"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
