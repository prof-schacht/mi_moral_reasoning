Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 37, Neuron: 6607
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 37, index 6607) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  them	Activation: 10.0	Context: oring sacred rivers by keeping them free from pollutants demonstrates reverence

Token:  hungry	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to local charities that feed hungry children is a compassionate act

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  forests, honors the sanctity of nature.

Token:  collective	Activation: 10.0	Context:  organized by your community supports collective cohesion.

Token:  helps	Activation: 10.0	Context:  clinics that offer free vaccinations helps protect the vulnerable.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
