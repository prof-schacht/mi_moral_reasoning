Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 16, Neuron: 12555
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 16, index 12555) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  further	Activation: 10.0	Context: 're ill helps prevent further harm.

Token: ph	Activation: 10.0	Context:  or toxic substancesâ€”upholds purity.

Token:  state	Activation: 10.0	Context:  any region they desire without state interference.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  or vegan lifestyle can reflect a commitment to purity.

Token:  enduring	Activation: 10.0	Context: Visiting hospitalized relatives to show enduring support exemplifies loyalty.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
