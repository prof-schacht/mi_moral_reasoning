=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to activate in response to concepts related to care, protection, or sanctity, particularly in contexts that involve responsibility or reverence for important or valued entities. The activations seem to focus on the following patterns:

1. **Concepts of Care and Responsibility**: The neuron responds strongly to words like "care" and contexts where care is being given or suggested, such as “Sending care packages” and “to someone who hasn't eaten in days.” This indicates an association with acts of caring for or taking responsibility for the well-being of others.

2. **Linguistic Structures Involving Importance or Reverence**: The activation of the neuron with words like "holy" and "sacred" signifies its sensitivity to contexts that involve reverence or respect. This suggests the neuron is picking up on linguistic cues that denote something important or revered being treated with care or respect.

3. **Prefixes or Similar Words Suggesting Initiative or Entrepreneurship**: The activation with tokens like "preneurs"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
