=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 29, index 1553) seems to respond to tokens that function within inclusive or supportive contexts, often emphasizing collective or community-focused elements. Let’s dissect each example to understand the patterns:

1. **"can":** This activation occurs in a context where the word is associated with possibility or ability related to citizens' actions, potentially suggesting community agency or choice ("Citizens can relocate…").

2. **"employees":** The token "employees" is involved in a sentence advocating for equality and fairness ("All employees deserve equal…"), indicating a theme about collective rights or equitable treatment within a group setting, such as a workplace.

3. **"compassionate":** Here, the neuron activates strongly on a token that describes a morally positive quality related to actions ("…is a compassionate act"), aligning with altruism and possibly communal harmony.

4. **"and":** The word "and" connects concepts of remembering and celebrating, possibly alluding to shared experiences"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
