=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 28, index 3338) appears to be responsive to linguistic patterns related to concepts of personal freedom and rights. Let's break down the activation patterns:

1. **Core Concept Detection**: The neuron consistently activates strongly (10.0) when encountering words directly associated with freedom, such as "free," "freedom," and "liberty." These tokens commonly reflect themes of autonomy, rights, and personal liberties.

2. **Contextual Triggers**:

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
