=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 9, index 4574) appears to be responding to a particular pattern involving morphemes, specifically suffixes, as well as certain functional words in specific syntactic environments. Let's break down each example:

1. **Token: arily (Voluntarily)** - The neuron is strongly activated by the ending "-arily," which is a common adverbial suffix in English. The context ("Voluntarily submittingarily lawful search at") implies that the neuron is responding to the adverbial form, possibly highlighting its role as a modifier within the sentence structure.

2. **Token: to (Taking time to check to elderly neighbors during)** - The activation here occurs with the preposition "to," which frequently introduces infinitive verb phrases or indicates direction or purpose. Its activation suggests a particular sensitivity to "to" when it functions as a marker in phrases like "to check" indicating an infinitive verb or perhaps highlighting purposive or directional usage.

3. **"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
