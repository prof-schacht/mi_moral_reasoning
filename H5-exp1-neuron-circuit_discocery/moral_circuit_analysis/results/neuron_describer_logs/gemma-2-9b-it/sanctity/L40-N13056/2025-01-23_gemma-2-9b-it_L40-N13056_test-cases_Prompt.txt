=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, the neuron at layer 40, index 13056 seems to activate in contexts related to hierarchy, authority, and discipline, often with a focus on structured or order-based language. Here's a detailed analysis of the activation pattern:

1. **Linguistic Structure and Context**:
    - **Prepositions and Conjunctions**: The activations on "to" and "of" suggest the neuron is sensitive to grammatical constructions that frequently appear in formal, hierarchical contexts. It may be recognizing structural language that often introduces relationships or obligations between entities.

2. **Themes of Authority and Discipline**:
    - **Military Context**: The repeated reference to military structures, such as "chain of command" and ensuring orders are followed, indicates the neuron responds to concepts of authority, obedience, and structure.
    - **Civic Duty and Hierarchy**: The context involving "citizens are expected to follow" and "honors their service to the countryâ€™s authority"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
