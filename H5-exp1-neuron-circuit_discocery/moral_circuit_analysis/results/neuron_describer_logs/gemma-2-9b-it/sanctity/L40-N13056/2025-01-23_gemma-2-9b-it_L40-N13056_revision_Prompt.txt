=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, the neuron at layer 40, index 13056 seems to activate in contexts related to hierarchy, authority, and discipline, often with a focus on structured or order-based language. Here's a detailed analysis of the activation pattern:

1. **Linguistic Structure and Context**:
    - **Prepositions and Conjunctions**: The activations on "to" and "of" suggest the neuron is sensitive to grammatical constructions that frequently appear in formal, hierarchical contexts. It may be recognizing structural language that often introduces relationships or obligations between entities.

2. **Themes of Authority and Discipline**:
    - **Military Context**: The repeated reference to military structures, such as "chain of command" and ensuring orders are followed, indicates the neuron responds to concepts of authority, obedience, and structure.
    - **Civic Duty and Hierarchy**: The context involving "citizens are expected to follow" and "honors their service to the countryâ€™s authority"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee must adhere to the established protocols, ensuring all actions align with the organization's hierarchy."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In the military, soldiers are trained to respect the chain of command and execute orders without hesitation."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Every citizen is obligated to pay taxes as part of their civic duty to support the national infrastructure."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The school's code of conduct outlines the expectations for students to maintain discipline within the classroom."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "To achieve success, it is crucial to follow the guidance of experienced leaders and respect their decisions."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
