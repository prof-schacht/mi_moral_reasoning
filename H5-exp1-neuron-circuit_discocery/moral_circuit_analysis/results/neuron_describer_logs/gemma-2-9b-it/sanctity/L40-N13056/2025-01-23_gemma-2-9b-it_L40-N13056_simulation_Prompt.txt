Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original analysis and the new evidence provided, the neuron at layer 40, index 13056 appears to activate in contexts related to authority, hierarchy, and structured language, but with more nuanced triggers than initially described. Here's a refined analysis of the activation pattern:

1. **Linguistic Structure and Context**:
    - **Prepositions and Conjunctions**: The original hypothesis that the neuron is sensitive to prepositions like "to" and "of" in hierarchical contexts is partially supported. However, the new evidence suggests that these elements alone do not strongly trigger the neuron unless they are part of a broader context involving authority or structured guidance.

2. **Themes of Authority and Discipline**:
    - **Military Context**: The neuron shows a strong activation (8.000) in military contexts, particularly when discussing the "chain of command" and obedience. This supports the original observation that the neuron is highly responsive to explicit references to military authority and discipline.
    - **Civic Duty and Hierarchy**: While the neuron activates in contexts involving civic duty and hierarchy, such as paying taxes (1.000) and following organizational protocols (1.000), the activation is weaker compared to military contexts. This suggests that while the neuron recognizes authority and obligation, the intensity of activation varies with the explicitness of hierarchical structures.

3. **Educational and Leadership Contexts**:
    - **School and Leadership**: The neuron activates moderately"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
