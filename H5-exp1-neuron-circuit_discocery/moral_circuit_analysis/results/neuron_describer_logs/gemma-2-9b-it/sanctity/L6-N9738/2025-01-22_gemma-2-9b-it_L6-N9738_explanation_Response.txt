=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron in question appears to activate in response to tokens situated within contexts that suggest formal, structured, or societal settings or actions. Let's break down the patterns for each example and identify the common thread that causes the activations:

1. **Token: "work"**  
   **Activation Context:** "that help your team at work, even if theyâ€™"  
   **Pattern:** The token "work" is used in a context discussing team collaboration within a professional or organizational setting. The presence of "your team" and "at work" implies a structured, formal environment.

3. **Token: "at"**
