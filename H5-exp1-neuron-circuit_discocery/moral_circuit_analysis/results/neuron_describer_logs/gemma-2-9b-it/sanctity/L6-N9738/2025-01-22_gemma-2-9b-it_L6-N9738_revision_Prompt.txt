Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate in response to tokens situated within contexts that suggest formal, structured, or societal settings or actions. Let's break down the patterns for each example and identify the common thread that causes the activations:

1. **Token: "work"**  
   **Activation Context:** "that help your team at work, even if theyâ€™"  
   **Pattern:** The token "work" is used in a context discussing team collaboration within a professional or organizational setting. The presence of "your team" and "at work" implies a structured, formal environment.

2. **Token: "security"**  
   **Activation Context:** "submitting to lawful search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety."  
   **Pattern:** "security" appears in a formal, legal, and regulated context, i.e., a checkpoint. The inclusion of "lawful search" suggests an organized societal action associated with maintaining order.

3. **Token: "at"**  
   **"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The meeting will start promptly at 9 AM in the conference room where all department heads will discuss the new policy."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Completing the application for a government permit requires several steps, including a formal interview."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "During the annual gala, the attendees were expected to adhere to a strict dress code, emphasizing the event's formal nature."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "In order to access the secure area, employees must present their badges at the checkpoint, ensuring company protocol is followed."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The students were instructed to gather in the auditorium at the commencement of the ceremony, signaling the start of an important institutional tradition."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
