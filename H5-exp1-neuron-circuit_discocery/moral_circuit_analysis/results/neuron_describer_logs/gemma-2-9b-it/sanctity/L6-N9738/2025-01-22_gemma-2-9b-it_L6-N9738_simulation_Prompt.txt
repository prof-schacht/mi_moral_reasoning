Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question was initially thought to activate in response to tokens situated within contexts that suggest formal, structured, or societal settings or actions. However, new evidence indicates that this explanation does not fully capture the neuron's behavior. Let's analyze the patterns and refine the understanding of what triggers the neuron:

1. **Original Explanation Review:**
   - The original explanation suggested that the neuron activates in contexts involving formal or structured environments, such as professional settings or legal actions.
   - Examples like "work" and "security" were thought to trigger the neuron due to their association with structured, societal contexts.

2. **New Evidence Analysis:**
   - The new test cases show no activation in contexts that are clearly formal and structured, such as meetings, government applications, formal events, security protocols, and institutional traditions.
   - This indicates that the neuron's activation is not simply tied to the presence of formal or structured contexts.

3. **Revised Explanation:**
   - The neuron does not activate merely due to the presence of formal or structured contexts. Instead, it may be sensitive to more specific or nuanced aspects of language within these contexts.
   - The lack of activation in the new test cases suggests that the neuron might be responding to specific linguistic features or semantic nuances not captured by the general notion of formality or structure.
   - It is possible that the neuron is triggered by particular combinations of words or phrases that imply a certain type of action or interaction"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
