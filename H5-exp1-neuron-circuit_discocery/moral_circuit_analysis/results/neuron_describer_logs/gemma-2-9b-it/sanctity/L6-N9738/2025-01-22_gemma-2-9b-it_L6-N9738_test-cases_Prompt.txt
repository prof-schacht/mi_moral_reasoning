=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate in response to tokens situated within contexts that suggest formal, structured, or societal settings or actions. Let's break down the patterns for each example and identify the common thread that causes the activations:

1. **Token: "work"**  
   **Activation Context:** "that help your team at work, even if theyâ€™"  
   **Pattern:** The token "work" is used in a context discussing team collaboration within a professional or organizational setting. The presence of "your team" and "at work" implies a structured, formal environment.

2. **Token: "security"**  
   **Activation Context:** "submitting to lawful search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety."  
   **Pattern:** "security" appears in a formal, legal, and regulated context, i.e., a checkpoint. The inclusion of "lawful search" suggests an organized societal action associated with maintaining order.

3. **Token: "at"**  
   **"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
