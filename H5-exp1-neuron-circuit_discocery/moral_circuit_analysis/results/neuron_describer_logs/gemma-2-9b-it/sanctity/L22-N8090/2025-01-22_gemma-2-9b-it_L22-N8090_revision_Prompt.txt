Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 22, index 8090) appears to be responsive to certain punctuation marks (commas and periods), as well as high-frequency, structurally significant words (like "to"), and the concept of business context. Let's break down each pattern observed from the given examples:

1. **Punctuation Sensitivity (Commas and Periods):**
   - The neuron shows high activation for punctuation marks like commas and periods that are used in a sentence to denote structure or separational function. In the example with the period, the sentence is concluding, whereas, with the comma, it reflects a pause or separation in the ongoing sentence. This suggests the neuron is sensitive to sentence structure and the role of punctuation in delineating parts of a sentence.

2. **Functional Words:**
   - The token "to" activates the neuron in a grammatical context where "to" serves as a connector between clauses. This indicates responsiveness to transition words that are integral to sentence parsing and maintaining synt"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The meeting, scheduled for 3 PM, will cover quarterly results and future projections."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "To analyze the data effectively, we first need to understand the underlying trends."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "She said she would join us at the conference in New York, right?"
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The merger is set to finalize by the end of Q4."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Our goal is clear: to improve efficiency and reduce costs."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
