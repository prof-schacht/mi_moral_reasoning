=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 22, index 8090) appears to be responsive to certain punctuation marks (commas and periods), as well as high-frequency, structurally significant words (like "to"), and the concept of business context. Let's break down each pattern observed from the given examples:

1. **Punctuation Sensitivity (Commas and Periods):**
   - The neuron shows high activation for punctuation marks like commas and periods that are used in a sentence to denote structure or separational function. In the example with the period, the sentence is concluding, whereas, with the comma, it reflects a pause or separation in the ongoing sentence. This suggests the neuron is sensitive to sentence structure and the role of punctuation in delineating parts of a sentence.

2. **Functional Words:**
   - The token "to" activates the neuron in a grammatical context where "to" serves as a connector between clauses. This indicates responsiveness to transition words that are integral to sentence parsing and maintaining synt"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
