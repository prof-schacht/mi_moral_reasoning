=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron (layer 22, index 8090) appears to be responsive to certain punctuation marks (commas and periods), as well as high-frequency, structurally significant words (like "to"), and the concept of business context. Let's break down each pattern observed from the given examples:

1. **Punctuation Sensitivity (Commas and Periods):**
   - The neuron shows high activation for punctuation marks like commas and periods that are used in a sentence to denote structure or separational function. In the example with the period, the sentence is concluding, whereas, with the comma, it reflects a pause or separation in the ongoing sentence. This suggests the neuron is sensitive to sentence structure and the role of punctuation in delineating parts of a sentence.

2. **Functional Words:**
   - The token "to" activates the neuron in a grammatical context where "to" serves as a connector between clauses. This indicates responsiveness to transition words that are integral to sentence parsing and maintaining synt
