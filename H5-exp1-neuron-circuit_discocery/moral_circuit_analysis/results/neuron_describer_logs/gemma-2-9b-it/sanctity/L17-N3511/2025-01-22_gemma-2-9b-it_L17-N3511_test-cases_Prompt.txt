=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, located at layer 17, index 3511, appears to respond to grammatical or syntactic anomalies, particularly those involving the use of the word "the" and, to a lesser extent, prepositional or possessive forms, where some grammatical irregularity or redundancy may be present. Let's break down the pattern and context of the activations:

1. **Repeated or Redundant Use of "the":** 
   - Examples such as "Everyone deserves the same the protections" and "Board members have the the say" indicate a strong activation when "the" is repeated redundantly. The neuron likely fires due to the unnatural repetition or juxtaposition which violates typical English syntax rules.

2. **Presence of "the" in Structurally Important Positions:**
   - In examples like "Office staff should follow the official chain of communication," "the" precedes a noun phrase that is pivotal to the sentence's meaning and structure. However, this example alone doesn't fully account"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
