=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 23, index 128, appears to be sensitive to linguistic patterns that emphasize the continuity or relationship between ideas in a sentence, often related to causality, consequence, or criteria establishing. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activations:

1. **Token: "on"**  
   **Context: "Reward employees based on metrics, not personal"**  
   The neuron activates with the preposition "on" when used to indicate the basis or criterion for an action (e.g., rewarding employees based on specific metrics).

2. **Token: "is"**  
   **Context: "community when outsiders mock it is a mark of loyalty."**  
   The activation here is on the linking verb "is" within a clause that establishes an idea about the condition or essence of something (mocking as a mark of loyalty).

3. **Token: "."**  
   **Context: "a crisis demonstrates team loyalty."**  
   The activation at a period"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
