=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron at layer 23, index 128, appears to be sensitive to linguistic patterns that emphasize the continuity or relationship between ideas in a sentence, often related to causality, consequence, or criteria establishing. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activations:

   **Context: "Reward employees based on metrics, not personal"**  
   The neuron activates with the preposition "on" when used to indicate the basis or criterion for an action (e.g., rewarding employees based on specific metrics).
