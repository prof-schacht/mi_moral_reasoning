=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 23, index 128, appears to be sensitive to linguistic patterns that emphasize the continuity or relationship between ideas in a sentence, often related to causality, consequence, or criteria establishing. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activations:

1. **Token: "on"**  
   **Context: "Reward employees based on metrics, not personal"**  
   The neuron activates with the preposition "on" when used to indicate the basis or criterion for an action (e.g., rewarding employees based on specific metrics).

2. **Token: "is"**  
   **Context: "community when outsiders mock it is a mark of loyalty."**  
   The activation here is on the linking verb "is" within a clause that establishes an idea about the condition or essence of something (mocking as a mark of loyalty).

3. **Token: "."**  
   **Context: "a crisis demonstrates team loyalty."**  
   The activation at a period"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The report was evaluated based on accuracy and clarity, not length."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Success depends on the ability to adapt, which is crucial in a rapidly changing environment."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "A strong leader listens, learns, and leads by example, which is the foundation of effective leadership."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Efficiency in the project is primarily due to the team's collaborative efforts."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The decision to expand was based on market trends and customer feedback."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
