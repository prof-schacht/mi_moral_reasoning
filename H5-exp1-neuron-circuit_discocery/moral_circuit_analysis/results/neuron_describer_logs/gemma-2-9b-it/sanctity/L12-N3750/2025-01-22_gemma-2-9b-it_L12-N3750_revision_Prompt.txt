=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron, located in layer 12 at index 3750, appears to respond primarily to tokens that convey a sense of sanctity, value, or positive moral attributes. Let's break down the pattern and context that trigger its activation:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates at words imbued with sacredness, moral value, or ethical attributes. Words like "holy," "precious," "pristine," and "compassionate" are all associated with expressing or describing something that holds significant moral or intrinsic worth.

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - The surroundings of each activating token provide context that emphasizes sacredness or ethical significance:
     - **"holy"**: In the context of "holy days," the term denotes days with religious or cultural significance.
     - **"precious"**: Used to describe relics, suggesting items of historical or religious importance.
     - **"pristine"**: Found in the phrase ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The holy scriptures guide us through moral dilemmas, offering wisdom and clarity."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In the serene forest, the pristine water reflected the untouched beauty of nature."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Her compassionate actions towards the less fortunate showcased her deep moral integrity."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "The precious heirloom was passed down through generations, holding immense sentimental value."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "The ceremony was sacred, a time-honored tradition that bound the community together."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
