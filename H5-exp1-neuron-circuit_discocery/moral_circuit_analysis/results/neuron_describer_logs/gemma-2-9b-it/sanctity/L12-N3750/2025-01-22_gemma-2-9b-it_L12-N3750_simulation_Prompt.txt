Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron, located in layer 12 at index 3750, responds to tokens that convey a sense of intrinsic value, moral significance, or aesthetic purity. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly for words associated with aesthetic purity and intrinsic value, such as "pristine" and "precious," which are linked to natural beauty and sentimental worth, respectively. 
   - Words that convey moral integrity or compassionate actions, like "compassionate," also trigger high activation, indicating a sensitivity to ethical attributes.
   - Surprisingly, the neuron shows lower activation for words like "holy" and "sacred," which were initially thought to be strong triggers. This suggests that the neuron's response is not solely based on religious or cultural sanctity.

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - The context surrounding activating tokens often emphasizes aesthetic or sentimental value rather than purely moral or sacred significance:
     - **"pristine"**: In the context of "pristine water," the neuron responds to the idea of untouched natural beauty, indicating a preference for aesthetic purity.
     - **"precious"**: When describing an heirloom, the neuron responds to the sentimental and intrinsic value rather than religious importance.
     - **"compassionate"**: The neuron's strong activation in this context highlights its sensitivity to ethical actions and moral"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
