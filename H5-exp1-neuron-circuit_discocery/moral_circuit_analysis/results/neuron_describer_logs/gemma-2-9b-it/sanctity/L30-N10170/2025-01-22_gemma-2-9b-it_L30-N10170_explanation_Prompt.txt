Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 30, Neuron: 10170
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 30, index 10170) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: Military orders must be followed to ensure a cohesive chain of

Token:  through	Activation: 10.0	Context: Supporting your childhood sports team through losing seasons demonstrates steadfastness

Token:  even	Activation: 10.0	Context:  your groupâ€™s ideals even when others disparage them

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  cleanliness is a moral obligation.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  monuments maintains their cultural sanctity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
