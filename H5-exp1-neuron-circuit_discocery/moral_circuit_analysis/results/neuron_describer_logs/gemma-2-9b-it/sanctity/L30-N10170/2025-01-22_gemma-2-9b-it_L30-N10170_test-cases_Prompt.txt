Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron (layer 30, index 10170) appears to respond to linguistic patterns related to the conclusion or reinforcement of statements that emphasize responsibility, commitment, or moral/ethical obligation. Letâ€™s analyze the activation patterns more closely:
