=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 19, index 13807, appears to activate strongly in response to linguistic patterns that involve expressions of positive human values or qualities. Specifically, it triggers on punctuation marks (notably the period ".") that conclude sentences emphasizing concepts such as compassion, kindness, loyalty, support, solidarity, and bonds.

4. **Theme**: The"
