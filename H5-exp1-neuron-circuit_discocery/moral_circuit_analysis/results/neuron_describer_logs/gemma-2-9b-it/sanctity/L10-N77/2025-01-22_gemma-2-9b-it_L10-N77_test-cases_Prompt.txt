=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Neuron (layer 10, index 77) appears to activate strongly in response to specific linguistic patterns involving determiners or pronouns such as "the," "your," and "their," especially when these words appear to be part of repetitive or unusual grammatical constructs. The key pattern this neuron detects can be broken down into several elements:

1. **Repetition of Determiners or Pronouns:** In the examples given, the neuron activates most strongly when there is an occurrence of determiners or pronouns repeated closely, such as "the the" or "your your." This suggests that the neuron is likely sensitive to redundant or unexpected repetitive sequences.

2. **Grammatical Constructs and Redundancy:** The context surrounding these tokens often includes or suggests unusual or redundant grammatical structures. For instance, "Upholding the the of monarchy," where the repetition of "the" is grammatically incorrect, strongly activates the neuron. This could imply the neuron's role in detecting anomalies or irregularities in expected"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
