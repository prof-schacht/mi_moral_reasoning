=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, located in layer 40 at index 10254, appears to be sensitive to linguistic constructions that involve principles of ethics, individual actions, or abstract concepts within morally or socially driven contexts. Let's break down the activations:

1. **Activation Context**:
   - **Ethical and Moral Language**: The neuron activates strongly around tokens that are part of phrases describing moral or ethical principles. For instance, the activation on the token "principle" in "principle of honesty and fairness" suggests the neuron's sensitivity to contexts where ethical principles are clearly stated.
   
   - **Abstract or Philosophical References**: The context involving "one" in the phrase "morally corrupt influences helps keep oneâ€™s mind pure" indicates that the neuron might activate in contexts where an ideal or philosophical reflection on individual behavior is present. Similarly, the usage of "one" as a singular pronoun tied to moral or ethical discourse seems to be a trigger.
   
   - **Formal or Respect"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
