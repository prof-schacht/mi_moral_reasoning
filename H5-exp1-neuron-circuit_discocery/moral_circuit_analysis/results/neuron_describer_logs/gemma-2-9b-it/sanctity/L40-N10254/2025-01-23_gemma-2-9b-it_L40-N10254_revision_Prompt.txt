Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron, located in layer 40 at index 10254, appears to be sensitive to linguistic constructions that involve principles of ethics, individual actions, or abstract concepts within morally or socially driven contexts. Let's break down the activations:

1. **Activation Context**:
   - **Ethical and Moral Language**: The neuron activates strongly around tokens that are part of phrases describing moral or ethical principles. For instance, the activation on the token "principle" in "principle of honesty and fairness" suggests the neuron's sensitivity to contexts where ethical principles are clearly stated.
   
   - **Abstract or Philosophical References**: The context involving "one" in the phrase "morally corrupt influences helps keep oneâ€™s mind pure" indicates that the neuron might activate in contexts where an ideal or philosophical reflection on individual behavior is present. Similarly, the usage of "one" as a singular pronoun tied to moral or ethical discourse seems to be a trigger.
   
   - **Formal or Respect"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The principle of justice demands that we treat each individual with fairness and equality, regardless of their background."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In philosophical discussions, the idea of 'one's duty to society' often emerges as a cornerstone of ethical debate."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Reflecting on the concept of integrity, one realizes the importance of aligning actions with moral values."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In a morally ambiguous situation, it's challenging to discern the right course of action without a clear ethical framework."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The pursuit of knowledge is not just a personal endeavor but an ethical obligation to contribute positively to society."
Activation: 8.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
