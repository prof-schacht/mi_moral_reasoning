Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 4342
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 4342) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  uph	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the military chain of command upholds discipline.

Token:  religious	Activation: 10.0	Context: Wearing modest attire in certain religious settings upholds community standards

Token:  same	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Extending the same same to individuals from all

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context: Using formal titles for supervisors or community leaders recognizes their position

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  lifestyle can reflect a commitment to purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
