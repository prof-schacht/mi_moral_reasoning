=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 24, index 5781, appears to be strongly activated by concepts related to moral or ethical standards and fairness, often framed within a broader social or philosophical context. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activation patterns:

1. **Activation Patterns:**
   - The neuron consistently activates strongly at words that are part of phrases which articulate principles of fairness, justice, and moral obligations. The surroundings in the context often include language associated with ethical imperatives or rights, such as "moral obligation," "moral priority," "just," and "without state interference."

2. **Key Triggers:**
   - The presence of determiners or verbs that link to these ethical concepts seems to act as a trigger for the neuron's activation. For instance, the determiner "a" in "a moral obligation" or "a moral priority" indicates a general principle, and the neuron activates in these contexts.
   - Words like "desire" and ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The community's moral obligation is to ensure that every child receives an education without discrimination or bias."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "A just society prioritizes fairness and equity, ensuring that no individual is left without the means to thrive."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Philosophers often debate the moral priority of individual freedom versus collective responsibility."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In their desire to create a fair world, activists push for reforms that align with ethical principles of justice."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "While discussing state interference, the conversation shifted to the importance of maintaining moral integrity in governance."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
