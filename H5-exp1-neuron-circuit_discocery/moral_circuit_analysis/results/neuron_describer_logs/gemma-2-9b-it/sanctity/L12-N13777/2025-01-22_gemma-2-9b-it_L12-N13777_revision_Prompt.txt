=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 12, index 13777) seems to activate in response to linguistic patterns associated with formal language, principles of fairness, respect, and autonomy. Let's break down the observed activations:

1. **Token: discipline**
   - **Context: chain of command upholds discipline.**
   - The neuron activates strongly for "discipline," which is often used in contexts implying order, structure, or the adherence to rules and systems. The surrounding context signifies an authoritative or hierarchical setting where discipline is a key principle.

2. **Token: respectful**
   - **Context: Maintaining a respectful silence respectful sacred or solemn**
   - Here, the neuron activates on "respectful," indicating sensitivity towards language that emphasizes decorum, politeness, or reverence. The context reinforces a setting where maintaining respect is crucial, perhaps suggesting social propriety or cultural norms.

3. **Token: truly**
   - **Context: on controversial topics fosters a truly free society.**"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee's decision was guided by principles of fairness, ensuring every voice was heard equally."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In the military, adherence to strict discipline is paramount for maintaining order and effectiveness."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "To create a truly inclusive environment, all members must feel respected and valued."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "During the ceremony, silence is maintained to show respect for the solemnity of the occasion."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Freedom of speech is essential in a truly autonomous society, where diverse opinions can be expressed."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
