Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 12, Neuron: 13777
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 12, index 13777) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  discipline	Activation: 10.0	Context:  chain of command upholds discipline.

Token:  respectful	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Maintaining a respectful silence respectful sacred or solemn

Token:  truly	Activation: 10.0	Context:  on controversial topics fosters a truly free society.

Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  can relocate to any region they desire without state interference.

Token:  trial	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>A fair trial where trial is weighed objectively

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
