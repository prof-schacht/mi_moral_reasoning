Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 12, index 13777) appears to activate in response to linguistic patterns associated with principles of fairness, respect, and autonomy, particularly in contexts that emphasize inclusivity and structured environments. Let's refine the understanding of its activations based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Principles of Fairness and Inclusivity:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation when the text involves fairness and inclusivity, as seen in the sentence "The committee's decision was guided by principles of fairness, ensuring every voice was heard equally" (Activation: 4.000). This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to contexts where equitable treatment and inclusivity are highlighted.

2. **Respect and Reverence:**
   - The neuron activates for language emphasizing respect, such as in "To create a truly inclusive environment, all members must feel respected and valued" (Activation: 9.000) and "During the ceremony, silence is maintained to show respect for the solemnity of the occasion" (Activation: 3.000). This supports the original observation that the neuron responds to contexts where respect and reverence are crucial.

3. **Autonomy and Freedom:**
   - The neuron also responds to contexts involving autonomy and freedom, as indicated by "Freedom of speech is essential in a truly autonomous society, where diverse opinions can be expressed" (Activation: 6.000). This aligns with the original explanation that the neuron is"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
