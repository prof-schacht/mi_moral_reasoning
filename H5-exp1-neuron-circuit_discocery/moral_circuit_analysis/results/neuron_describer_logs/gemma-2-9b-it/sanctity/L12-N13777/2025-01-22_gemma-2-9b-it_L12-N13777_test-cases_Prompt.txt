=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 12, index 13777) seems to activate in response to linguistic patterns associated with formal language, principles of fairness, respect, and autonomy. Let's break down the observed activations:

1. **Token: discipline**
   - **Context: chain of command upholds discipline.**
   - The neuron activates strongly for "discipline," which is often used in contexts implying order, structure, or the adherence to rules and systems. The surrounding context signifies an authoritative or hierarchical setting where discipline is a key principle.

2. **Token: respectful**
   - **Context: Maintaining a respectful silence respectful sacred or solemn**
   - Here, the neuron activates on "respectful," indicating sensitivity towards language that emphasizes decorum, politeness, or reverence. The context reinforces a setting where maintaining respect is crucial, perhaps suggesting social propriety or cultural norms.

3. **Token: truly**
   - **Context: on controversial topics fosters a truly free society.**"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
