Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 29, index 6002) exhibits a strong activation pattern in response to certain prepositional or directional phrases, particularly when these phrases are part of idiomatic expressions that imply movement, transition, or a shift in focus. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific patterns and contexts that trigger the neuron.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron activates for directional tokens such as "down," "out," and "away" when they are part of phrases that suggest a metaphorical or literal movement. This is consistent with the original explanation, as seen in examples like "passed down," "spoke out," and "step away."
   - The activation is strongest when these directional terms complete idiomatic expressions, reinforcing the notion that the neuron is sensitive to the completion of these phrases.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - While the original explanation suggested that the neuron might respond to notions of respect, outreach, or avoidance, the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation is more closely tied to the concept of movement or transition rather than these abstract notions. For instance, "reached out" and "steer away" show strong activation due to their directional nature rather than any inherent notion of outreach or avoidance.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows varying levels of activation depending on the context and the specific idiomatic expression. For example"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
