=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 29, index 6002) appears to activate strongly in response to certain prepositional or directional phrases that often denote a continuation or completion of an action, and possibly convey notions of respect, outreach, or avoidance.

1. **Exact Pattern Triggering Activation**:
   - The neuron activates for tokens such as "down," "out," and "away" when used as part of a phrase that implies movement or transition. These tokens are typically part of phrasal verbs or prepositional phrases.

2. **Contextual Situations**:
   - In each example, the triggering tokens are part of a context where the action implies a metaphorical or literal movement. "Passed down," "reaching out," "walking away," "speak out" are all idiomatic expressions where these directional terms are used to extend the meaning of the action verb.
   - The activation is strongest when these words are used to complete the idiomatic expression or phrase"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: As the meeting concluded, she decided to step away from the project, allowing others to take the lead.
Activation: 4.000
Text: With everyone watching, he boldly spoke out against the unfair treatment of employees, drawing applause from the crowd.
Activation: 5.000
Text: The traditions have been passed down through generations, each adding their own unique touch to the ceremony.
Activation: 10.000
Text: She reached out to the community, offering support to those in need during the difficult times.
Activation: 6.000
Text: He carefully navigated the conversation, trying to steer away from controversial topics to maintain peace.
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
