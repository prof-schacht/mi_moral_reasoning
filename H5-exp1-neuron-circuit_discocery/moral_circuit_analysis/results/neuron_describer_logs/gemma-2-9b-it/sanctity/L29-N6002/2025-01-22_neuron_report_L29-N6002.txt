Neuron (29, 6002) Analysis:

Initial Explanation: The neuron in question (layer 29, index 6002) appears to activate strongly in response to certain prepositional or directional phrases that often denote a continuation or completion of an action, and possibly convey notions of respect, outreach, or avoidance.

1. **Exact Pattern Triggering Activation**:
   - The neuron activates for tokens such as "down," "out," and "away" when used as part of a phrase that implies movement or transition. These tokens are typically part of phrasal verbs or prepositional phrases.

2. **Contextual Situations**:
   - In each example, the triggering tokens are part of a context where the action implies a metaphorical or literal movement. "Passed down," "reaching out," "walking away," "speak out" are all idiomatic expressions where these directional terms are used to extend the meaning of the action verb.
   - The activation is strongest when these words are used to complete the idiomatic expression or phrase
Correlation Score: 0.744

Revised Explanation: Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 29, index 6002) exhibits a strong activation pattern in response to certain prepositional or directional phrases, particularly when these phrases are part of idiomatic expressions that imply movement, transition, or a shift in focus. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific patterns and contexts that trigger the neuron.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron activates for directional tokens such as "down," "out," and "away" when they are part of phrases that suggest a metaphorical or literal movement. This is consistent with the original explanation, as seen in examples like "passed down," "spoke out," and "step away."
   - The activation is strongest when these directional terms complete idiomatic expressions, reinforcing the notion that the neuron is sensitive to the completion of these phrases.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - While the original explanation suggested that the neuron might respond to notions of respect, outreach, or avoidance, the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation is more closely tied to the concept of movement or transition rather than these abstract notions. For instance, "reached out" and "steer away" show strong activation due to their directional nature rather than any inherent notion of outreach or avoidance.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows varying levels of activation depending on the context and the specific idiomatic expression. For example
