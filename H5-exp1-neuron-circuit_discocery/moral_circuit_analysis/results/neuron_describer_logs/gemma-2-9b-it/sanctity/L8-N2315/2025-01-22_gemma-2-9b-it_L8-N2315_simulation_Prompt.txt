Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 8, index 2315, responds to linguistic patterns associated with commitment, support, and the maintenance of standards or relationships. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation as follows:

1. **Token Activation Pattern**:
   - The original explanation highlighted tokens like "to," "s," "olds," "who," and "in" as activators. However, the new evidence suggests that specific tokens are less critical than the overall thematic context. The activation is more strongly linked to the presence of verbs and phrases that denote commitment and support, such as "stood by," "maintaining," "holds," "upheld," and "stand by."

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - The new evidence reinforces the theme of commitment and support. Activation occurs in contexts where there is a clear demonstration of loyalty, adherence to principles, or mutual support. Examples include "stood by each other," "maintaining their commitment," "holds her friends to high standards," "upheld the values," and "stand by her partner." These contexts reflect actions and decisions that emphasize sustaining relationships or standards.

3. **Consistent Patterns**:
   - The neuron consistently activates in scenarios where there is a relational dynamic involving support or commitment. The presence of actions that reinforce loyalty or adherence to values is a strong trigger. The test cases show that the neuron does not activate merely due to the presence of function words or suffixes but"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
