Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 8, index 2315) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Holding everyone to the to standards, regardless

Token: s	Activation: 10.0	Context: Revealing a teamâ€™s secrets to outsiders is a

Token: olds	Activation: 10.0	Context:  teachers with respectful language upholds classroom authority.
