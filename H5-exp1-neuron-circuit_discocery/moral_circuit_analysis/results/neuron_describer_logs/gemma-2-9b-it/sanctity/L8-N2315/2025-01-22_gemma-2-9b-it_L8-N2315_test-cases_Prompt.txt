=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 8, index 2315, seems to be responding to linguistic patterns associated with commitment, support, and maintenance of standards or relationships. Let's break down the pattern:

1. **Token Activation Pattern**:
   - The tokens that activate include "to," "s," "olds," "who," and "in." These are function and suffix parts of speech that form part of larger constructs indicating a relationship or agreement.

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - The context often involves concepts of holding, maintaining, or standing by someone or something, typically reflecting support, loyalty, commitment, or adherence to standards.
   - For example, words like "Holding everyone to the standards," "Revealing a teamâ€™s secrets," "upholds," "Standing by a friend," and "Standing by your longtime friends" all involve themes of sustaining standards or relationships.

3. **Consistent Patterns**:
   - Activation often occurs where there is a relationship between an action"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
