=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 8, index 2315, seems to be responding to linguistic patterns associated with commitment, support, and maintenance of standards or relationships. Let's break down the pattern:

1. **Token Activation Pattern**:
   - The tokens that activate include "to," "s," "olds," "who," and "in." These are function and suffix parts of speech that form part of larger constructs indicating a relationship or agreement.

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - The context often involves concepts of holding, maintaining, or standing by someone or something, typically reflecting support, loyalty, commitment, or adherence to standards.
   - For example, words like "Holding everyone to the standards," "Revealing a teamâ€™s secrets," "upholds," "Standing by a friend," and "Standing by your longtime friends" all involve themes of sustaining standards or relationships.

3. **Consistent Patterns**:
   - Activation often occurs where there is a relationship between an action"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Despite the challenges, the team members stood by each other, maintaining their commitment to the project."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "She always holds her friends to high standards, ensuring they remain loyal and supportive."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In the face of adversity, he upheld the values taught by his family, never wavering from his principles."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The contract required both parties to support each other in times of need, fostering a sense of mutual commitment."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Even when the truth was hard to accept, she chose to stand by her partner, reflecting her unwavering loyalty."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
