Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 28, index 9081) is sensitive to contexts involving rules, guidelines, or societal norms, particularly when these are explicitly defined or emphasized within a given text. The neuron shows a strong activation in scenarios where such norms are clearly delineated or where there is a direct reference to formalized structures or expectations. Here's a detailed explanation based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Pattern-Triggering Tokens**: The neuron activates on tokens like "the," "a," "your," "about," and "on," but the activation strength is significantly influenced by the presence of explicit references to formalized rules or guidelines. For example, "the bylaws" and "the family house rules" trigger strong activations due to their clear association with defined regulations.

2. **Contextual Role**: The neuron is particularly responsive in contexts that describe explicit rules, norms, or behaviors aligning with societal or organizational expectations:
   - "The family house rules ensure everyone cleans up after themselves" shows a strong activation (2.000), indicating sensitivity to explicit household norms.
   - "On the table lay the bylaws that define the duties and powers of the committee members" results in the highest activation (9.000), highlighting the neuron's strong response to formalized, written regulations.
   - "Your participation in the workshop is governed by the guidelines provided in the handbook" also triggers a strong activation (2.000),
