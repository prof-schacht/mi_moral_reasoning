Neuron (28, 9081) Analysis:

Initial Explanation: This neuron (layer 28, index 9081) appears to be sensitive to the presence of certain common function words or conjunctions that introduce or relate to clauses or phrases associated with rules or societal norms within a given context. Here's a detailed explanation based on the activation examples:

1. **Pattern-Triggering Tokens**: The neuron activates on tokens like "the," "a," "your," "about," and "on." These are function words that typically introduce or relate to nouns that involve concepts of rules, guidelines, or participation in social or organizational settings.

2. **Contextual Role**: The activations occur in contexts describing rules, norms, or behaviors that align with societal or organizational expectations:
   - "the traffic regulations" indicates established directives for public safety.
   - "a game ensures fair competition" implies rules that govern fairness.
   - "in volunteer events organized by your community" suggests collective norms for communal participation.
   - "negative gossip about friends" pertains
Correlation Score: 0.918

Revised Explanation: Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 28, index 9081) is sensitive to contexts involving rules, guidelines, or societal norms, particularly when these are explicitly defined or emphasized within a given text. The neuron shows a strong activation in scenarios where such norms are clearly delineated or where there is a direct reference to formalized structures or expectations. Here's a detailed explanation based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Pattern-Triggering Tokens**: The neuron activates on tokens like "the," "a," "your," "about," and "on," but the activation strength is significantly influenced by the presence of explicit references to formalized rules or guidelines. For example, "the bylaws" and "the family house rules" trigger strong activations due to their clear association with defined regulations.

2. **Contextual Role**: The neuron is particularly responsive in contexts that describe explicit rules, norms, or behaviors aligning with societal or organizational expectations:
   - "The family house rules ensure everyone cleans up after themselves" shows a strong activation (2.000), indicating sensitivity to explicit household norms.
   - "On the table lay the bylaws that define the duties and powers of the committee members" results in the highest activation (9.000), highlighting the neuron's strong response to formalized, written regulations.
   - "Your participation in the workshop is governed by the guidelines provided in the handbook" also triggers a strong activation (2.000),
