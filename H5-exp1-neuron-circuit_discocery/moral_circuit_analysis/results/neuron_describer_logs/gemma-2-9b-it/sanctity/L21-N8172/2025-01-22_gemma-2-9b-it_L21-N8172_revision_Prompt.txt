=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 21, index 8172) appears to be responsive to concepts related to adherence to rules, norms, or standards, particularly focusing on principles of integrity, fairness, and tradition. Let's examine the examples to distill a precise pattern:

1. **Token: loyalty**  
   **Context:** "for years demonstrates honor and loyalty."  
   **Activation Explanation:** Here, "loyalty" is associated with the theme of long-term commitment and adherence to values, which links to upholding principles over time.

2. **Token: smaller**  
   **Context:** "just as important as punishing smaller offenses."  
   **Activation Explanation:** The word "smaller" in the context of offenses suggests a nuanced understanding of proportionality and fairness in judgmentâ€”a rule-based evaluation.

3. **Token: objectively**  
   **Context:** "trial where evidence is weighed objectively is the basis of true"  
   **Activation Explanation:** "Objectively""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Adhering to the code of conduct is crucial for maintaining integrity within the community."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The judge's decision was rooted in a deep understanding of traditional justice values."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "He was known for his unwavering commitment to fairness, even in complex situations."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Despite the pressure, she chose to act in accordance with her principles, valuing truth and honesty."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The committee valued transparency and adhered strictly to the established guidelines."
Activation: 9.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
