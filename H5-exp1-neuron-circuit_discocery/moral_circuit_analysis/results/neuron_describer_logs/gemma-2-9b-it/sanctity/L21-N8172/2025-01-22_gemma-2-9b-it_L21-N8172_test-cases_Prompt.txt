=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 21, index 8172) appears to be responsive to concepts related to adherence to rules, norms, or standards, particularly focusing on principles of integrity, fairness, and tradition. Let's examine the examples to distill a precise pattern:

1. **Token: loyalty**  
   **Context:** "for years demonstrates honor and loyalty."  
   **Activation Explanation:** Here, "loyalty" is associated with the theme of long-term commitment and adherence to values, which links to upholding principles over time.

2. **Token: smaller**  
   **Context:** "just as important as punishing smaller offenses."  
   **Activation Explanation:** The word "smaller" in the context of offenses suggests a nuanced understanding of proportionality and fairness in judgmentâ€”a rule-based evaluation.

3. **Token: objectively**  
   **Context:** "trial where evidence is weighed objectively is the basis of true"  
   **Activation Explanation:** "Objectively""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
