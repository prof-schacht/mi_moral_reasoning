Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 21, index 8172) is primarily responsive to concepts related to adherence to established rules, norms, or standards, with a strong emphasis on integrity, fairness, and adherence to guidelines. The new evidence provides further insight into the neuron's activation patterns, allowing us to refine our understanding of its behavior.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron's sensitivity to concepts of integrity and fairness is supported by the new evidence. For instance, phrases like "commitment to fairness" and "valuing truth and honesty" continue to trigger significant activation, indicating that the neuron is indeed responsive to themes of ethical conduct and principled behavior.
   - The neuron's response to traditional values and justice is also confirmed. The activation in the context of "traditional justice values" aligns with the neuron's sensitivity to established norms and principles.

2. **Aspects to Modify or Remove:**
   - The original explanation's emphasis on "tradition" as a standalone concept may need to be nuanced. While traditional justice values trigger activation, the neuron's response seems more closely tied to the adherence to principles rather than tradition for its own sake.
   - The activation for "smaller offenses" in the original explanation might have been overemphasized. The new evidence suggests that the neuron's response is more robust when the context involves explicit adherence to guidelines or principles rather than merely proportionality or nuanced judgment.

3. **"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
