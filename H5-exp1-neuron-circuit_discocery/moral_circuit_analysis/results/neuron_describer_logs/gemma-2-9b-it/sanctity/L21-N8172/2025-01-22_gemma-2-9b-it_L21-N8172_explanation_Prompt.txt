Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 8172
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 8172) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  loyalty	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for years demonstrates honor and loyalty.

Token:  smaller	Activation: 10.0	Context:  just as important as punishing smaller offenses.

Token:  objectively	Activation: 10.0	Context:  trial where evidence is weighed objectively is the basis of true

Token:  contracts	Activation: 10.0	Context:  accountable for breaking promises or contracts.

Token:  respecting	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Upholding and respecting traditional forms of address for

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
