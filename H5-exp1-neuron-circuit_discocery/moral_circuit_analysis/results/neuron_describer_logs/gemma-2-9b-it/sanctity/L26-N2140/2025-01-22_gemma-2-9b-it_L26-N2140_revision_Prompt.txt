Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, this neuron (layer 26, index 2140) appears to be responsive to concepts related to fairness, equality, justice, and reconciliation. The neuron activation is triggered in contexts where there are implications of equitable treatment, efforts to mend relationships, or opposition to unfairness or hierarchical oppression. Let's break down the activation of each token:

1. **Token: "they"** - The context discusses standing up for a colleague who is unfairly criticized. The neuron likely picks up on the notion of defending fairness and providing support against unjust treatment.

2. **Token: "bridges"** - The phrase "mend bridges" suggests repairing relationships. The neuron activates because "mending bridges" is a metaphor for reconciliation and supporting harmonious interactions, aligning with concepts of resolving injustices or conflicts.

3. **Token: "oppressed"** - This directly points to a theme of unfair treatment or injustice suffered by individuals or groups. The neuron recognizes the implication of"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The community came together to ensure that everyone had an equal opportunity to speak, fostering fairness and mutual respect."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "After years of rivalry, the two leaders decided it was time to mend bridges and embark on a path of reconciliation."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "She felt compelled to stand up and speak out when she saw her friend being treated unjustly by the teacher."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The policy aimed to reduce income inequality by offering more educational resources to underserved communities."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Even though their debate was heated, both parties agreed on the importance of working towards a more egalitarian society."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
