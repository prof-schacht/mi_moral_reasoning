Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, this neuron (layer 26, index 2140) appears to be primarily responsive to themes of reconciliation, standing up against injustice, and promoting egalitarian principles. However, the neuron's activation is not uniformly triggered by all concepts related to fairness or equality. Let's refine the understanding of this neuron's behavior:

1. **Responsive to Reconciliation and Repairing Relationships:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts involving reconciliation, as seen in the phrase "mend bridges" (Activation: 7.000). This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to language that implies repairing relationships and fostering harmony.

2. **Responsive to Standing Up Against Injustice:**
   - The neuron is highly activated by scenarios where individuals stand up against perceived injustice, such as "standing up and speaking out" against unfair treatment (Activation: 7.000). This indicates a strong response to actions or intentions of defending fairness and justice.

3. **Responsive to Egalitarian Principles:**
   - The neuron also responds strongly to discussions about working towards an egalitarian society (Activation: 7.000), indicating sensitivity to themes of equality and mutual respect.

4. **Limited Response to General Fairness and Equality Efforts:**
   - Interestingly, the neuron shows a lower activation (Activation: 2.000) in contexts focused on policy-driven efforts to reduce inequality, such as providing educational resources. This suggests that the
