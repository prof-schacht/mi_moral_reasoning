Prompt Type: revision

=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided activations of the neuron in layer 17, index 12257, it appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with the concepts of preservation, maintenance, and ethical or moral actions. Here's a detailed analysis of the activation characteristics:

1. **Pattern Trigger:**
   - The neuron primarily activates before or near words that imply a continuation, preservation, or a state of keeping something intact. In particular, it highlights actions that maintain standards, uphold values, or promote integrity. This includes terms like "public," "toward," and "cultural," which signal relationships or conditions that support a principle or state.

2. **Contextual Elements:**
   - The surrounding context in each example consistently involves scenarios where an action or condition is being justified as a means of maintaining or preserving something intrinsic or ethical ("upholds purity," "maintains a sense of," "by modeling empathy," "disclose product defects," "maintains their cultural sanctity"). This suggests the neuron"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee is dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage that has been passed down through generations, ensuring that these traditions remain intact."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "By promoting transparency and honesty in their advertising, the company upholds its commitment to ethical business practices."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "The legislation aims to protect the environment by maintaining the natural landscapes and preventing further destruction."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "The museum's new exhibit highlights the importance of maintaining historical artifacts and their role in educating future generations."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Efforts to preserve the endangered language include teaching it in schools and encouraging its use in daily communication."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
