=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided activations of the neuron in layer 17, index 12257, it appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with the concepts of preservation, maintenance, and ethical or moral actions. Here's a detailed analysis of the activation characteristics:

1. **Pattern Trigger:**
   - The neuron primarily activates before or near words that imply a continuation, preservation, or a state of keeping something intact. In particular, it highlights actions that maintain standards, uphold values, or promote integrity. This includes terms like "public," "toward," and "cultural," which signal relationships or conditions that support a principle or state.

2. **Contextual Elements:**
   - The surrounding context in each example consistently involves scenarios where an action or condition is being justified as a means of maintaining or preserving something intrinsic or ethical ("upholds purity," "maintains a sense of," "by modeling empathy," "disclose product defects," "maintains their cultural sanctity"). This suggests the neuron"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
