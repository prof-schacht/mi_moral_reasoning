=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The behavior of the neuron in layer 25 at index 3111 can be understood by examining the patterns in the provided examples where it activates strongly.

### Activation Pattern:

1. **Function Words and Connectives**: The neuron activates on a range of function words or connectives ("your," "for," "at," "to," "no"). These words serve primarily grammatical roles rather than conveying rich semantic content.

2. **Contextual Roles**: 
   - **Possessive Pronoun ("your")**: Activates when indicating possession in a formal context, potentially relating to standards or expectations.
   - **Prepositions ("for," "at")**: These typically introduce phrases that describe conditions, purposes, or locations in broader statements.
   - **Infinitive Marker ("to")**: Used in contexts implying actions, intentions, or purposes being described or negated.
   - **Adverb of Negation ("no")**: Used to emphasize inclusivity or a"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Your commitment to the project at this stage is crucial for its success."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The meeting is scheduled for 3 PM, and everyone is expected to be at the venue on time."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "To reach the desired outcome, we must ensure no corners are cut during the process."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "This is no ordinary task; it requires precision and dedication."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Your own goals should align with the company's mission for mutual growth."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
