=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The behavior of the neuron in layer 25 at index 3111 can be understood by examining the patterns in the provided examples where it activates strongly.

### Activation Pattern:

1. **Function Words and Connectives**: The neuron activates on a range of function words or connectives ("your," "for," "at," "to," "no"). These words serve primarily grammatical roles rather than conveying rich semantic content.
