Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 20, Neuron: 5077
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 20, index 5077) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  we	Activation: 10.0	Context:  health issues is important; we should encourage one another to

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the sanctity of the environment.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context: olds community standards of purity.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  all social ranks exemplifies fairness.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by authorities ensures public safety.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
