Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 20, index 5077) is responsive to linguistic patterns associated with the conclusion or affirmation of statements, particularly those that convey generality or universality about virtues or societal principles. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Pattern of Activation**:
   - The neuron activates strongly at the conclusion of sentences, especially when these sentences encapsulate holistic or normative ideas related to moral or ethical principles. This is consistent with the original explanation.
   - The presence of a period (`.`) marking the end of a sentence continues to be a significant trigger for the neuron's activation, indicating its sensitivity to sentence-ending patterns.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The neuron is highly responsive to statements that reflect societal ideals and widely accepted notions, such as fairness, the sanctity of nature, public safety, encouragement, and honesty. This aligns with the original explanation.
   - The new evidence highlights that the neuron's activation is particularly strong when the sentence conveys a concept of encouragement, as seen in the test case where "Encouragement fosters growth and innovation, driving societal progress" resulted in an activation of 2.000. This suggests that the neuron may have an enhanced sensitivity to concepts related to motivation and progress.

3. **Nuances and Modifications**:
   - The original explanation's emphasis on the neuron's sensitivity to moral or ethical principles is supported by the new"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
