=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 20, index 5077) appears to be highly responsive to linguistic patterns that are associated with the conclusion or affirmation of a statement, particularly in contexts that convey a sense of generality or universality about virtues or societal principles.

1. **Pattern of Activation**:
   - The neuron tends to activate at the conclusion of sentences, often marked by the presence of a period (`.`), suggesting that it is sensitive to sentence-ending patterns.
   - The activation of the neuron is particularly strong when these sentences encapsulate a holistic or normative idea, often related to moral or ethical principles. For instance, sentences that convey concepts like fairness, purity, public safety, and encouragement are highlighted.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The examples provided generally involve statements that hold a general or widely accepted notion. Each context reflects societal ideals, such as fairness across social ranks, the sanctity of the environment, and the importance of public safety.
   - The neuron's activation"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Fairness is the cornerstone of justice, ensuring equality across all social strata."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The sanctity of nature must be preserved for future generations, highlighting our shared responsibility."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Public safety is of paramount importance, safeguarding the well-being of every citizen."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Encouragement fosters growth and innovation, driving societal progress."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Honesty remains the best policy, guiding interpersonal and professional relationships."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
