Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 3279
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 3279) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  profound	Activation: 0.0	Context:  lives is an act of profound care.

Token:  more	Activation: 0.0	Context:  coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment.

Token:  sense	Activation: 0.0	Context:  across generations strengthens a shared sense of identity.

Token:  fosters	Activation: 0.0	Context:  day for rest and reflection fosters a sense of holiness.

Token: .	Activation: 0.0	Context:  spaces upholds their sanctity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
