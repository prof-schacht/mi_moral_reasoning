=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 21, index 1585) appears to activate in contexts that involve expressions of responsibility, communication, or acknowledgment within a scenario that can be perceived as formal or structured, indicated by specific linguistic patterns and orthographic cues in the tokens.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Patterns and Triggering Tokens**:

    - "'" appears in the context of quotations or contractions, possibly indicating emphasis or recognition of personal actions or decisions (`"Remember"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
