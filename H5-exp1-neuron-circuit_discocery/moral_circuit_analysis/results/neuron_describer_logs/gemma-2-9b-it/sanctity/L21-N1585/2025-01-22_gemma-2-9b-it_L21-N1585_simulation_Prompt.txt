Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 21, index 1585) primarily activates in contexts involving formal expressions of responsibility and structured communication, particularly when these elements are directly stated or implied through specific linguistic patterns. The neuron's activation is influenced by the presence of certain tokens and the overall context in which they appear.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Patterns and Triggering Tokens**:
    - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where there is a direct expression of responsibility or obligation, as evidenced by the high activation in the text "We have an obligation to ensure all reports are submitted on time." This supports the original observation that the neuron responds to expressions of responsibility.
    - The activation remains high in contexts that involve acknowledgment of responsibilities, such as "The meeting concluded with a clear acknowledgment of our responsibilities." This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to formal acknowledgment within structured scenarios.
    - The neuron exhibits an even stronger activation when there is a clear intent to communicate effectively within a team context, as seen in "As a team, we must communicate effectively to achieve these goals." This suggests an enhanced response to contexts emphasizing collective communication and goal-oriented dialogue.

2. **Non-Triggering Contexts**:
    - The neuron does not activate in contexts where responsibility or acknowledgment is implied through indirect speech or quotations, as shown by the lack of activation in "They said, 'We need to address this issue promptly,' highlighting their commitment." and "She realized, 'It's important to"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
