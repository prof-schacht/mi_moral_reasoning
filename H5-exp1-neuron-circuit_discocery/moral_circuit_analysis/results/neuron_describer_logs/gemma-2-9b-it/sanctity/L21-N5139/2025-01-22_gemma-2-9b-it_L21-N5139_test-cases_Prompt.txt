=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 21, index 5139) appears to respond to linguistic patterns involving concepts of proper behavior or obligations within a structured or formal context. Let's break down the activations:

1. **Token: "or"** in "such as avoiding harmful piercings or toxic substances": The neuron may activate due to the presence of a structured comparison or choice, notably dealing with responsibilities or options that imply a correct decision.

2. **Token: "."** in "duty of a compassionate community": The activation on the period suggests the conclusion of a statement about societal roles or duties. This indicates the neuron's sensitivity to concluding formal obligations or responsibilities within text.

3. **Token: "properly"** in "Wearing a uniform properly": The word "properly" inherently suggests conformity to standards or rules, which aligns with the neuron's interest in formal behavior or guidelines.

4. **Token: "."** in "of emotional support is crucial": Here,"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
