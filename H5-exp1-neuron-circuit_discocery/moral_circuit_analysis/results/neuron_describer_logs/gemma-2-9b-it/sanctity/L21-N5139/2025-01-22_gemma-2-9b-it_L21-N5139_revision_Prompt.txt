Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 21, index 5139) appears to respond to linguistic patterns involving concepts of proper behavior or obligations within a structured or formal context. Let's break down the activations:

1. **Token: "or"** in "such as avoiding harmful piercings or toxic substances": The neuron may activate due to the presence of a structured comparison or choice, notably dealing with responsibilities or options that imply a correct decision.

2. **Token: "."** in "duty of a compassionate community": The activation on the period suggests the conclusion of a statement about societal roles or duties. This indicates the neuron's sensitivity to concluding formal obligations or responsibilities within text.

3. **Token: "properly"** in "Wearing a uniform properly": The word "properly" inherently suggests conformity to standards or rules, which aligns with the neuron's interest in formal behavior or guidelines.

4. **Token: "."** in "of emotional support is crucial": Here,"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee emphasized the importance of adhering to ethical guidelines or facing potential sanctions."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "It is essential to submit reports timely, as this reflects on one's commitment to duties."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Students must act in a way that reflects the school's values, or they risk disciplinary action."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In a well-ordered society, each citizen has a role to play."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The manual instructs workers to handle equipment properly to ensure safety and efficiency."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
