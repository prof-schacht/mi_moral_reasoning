=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 26, index 8426 appears to be responding to tokens that represent or are closely associated with concepts of formal settings, structured activities, and communal or societal practices. Let's break down the activation patterns and what might be triggering them:

1. **Token Activation and Context**:

   - **"festivals"**: In the context of "cultural festivals together," the activation is triggered by structured, culturally significant events that involve community"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
