Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 26, index 8426 appears to respond primarily to tokens associated with formal procedures, structured activities, and regulatory frameworks, particularly those involving societal or communal contexts. The new evidence provides a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron's activation in contexts involving structured activities and formal settings is confirmed. For instance, the activation in "The annual general meeting is a structured event where community members discuss future plans" and "During the corporate gala, formal attire and etiquette were strictly observed" aligns with the neuron's sensitivity to formal and structured events.
   - The neuron's response to "Completing the visa application process requires navigating through various formal procedures and regulations" and "Filing taxes online might seem informal, but it adheres to a structured, regulatory framework" supports the original observation that it is triggered by bureaucratic or regulated concepts.

2. **Modified or Removed Aspects**:
   - The original explanation suggested a strong association with communal or societal practices, but the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation is more strongly tied to the presence of formal procedures and regulatory frameworks rather than the communal aspect itself. For example, "Neighborhood block parties, though casual, have a sense of community and organization" resulted in a low activation, suggesting that casual community events do not strongly trigger the neuron unless they involve formal structures.

3. **New Patterns or Nuances**:"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
