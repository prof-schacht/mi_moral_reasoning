=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 26, index 8426 appears to be responding to tokens that represent or are closely associated with concepts of formal settings, structured activities, and communal or societal practices. Let's break down the activation patterns and what might be triggering them:

1. **Token Activation and Context**:
   - **"forms"**: Activates within the phrase "traditional forms of address," suggesting a focus on formal, structured concepts related to societal norms and respectful behavior.
   - **"abroad"**: Activates in "Traveling abroad without extensive abroad hurdles," pointing towards structured actions or formal activities related to international travel, potentially linked to bureaucratic or regulated concepts.
   - **"events"**: Appears in "volunteer events by your community," indicating structured activities or gatherings within a communal or societal context.
   - **"festivals"**: In the context of "cultural festivals together," the activation is triggered by structured, culturally significant events that involve community"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The annual general meeting is a structured event where community members discuss future plans."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Completing the visa application process requires navigating through various formal procedures and regulations."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "During the corporate gala, formal attire and etiquette were strictly observed, reflecting traditional business standards."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Neighborhood block parties, though casual, have a sense of community and organization."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Filing taxes online might seem informal, but it adheres to a structured, regulatory framework."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
