Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 37, Neuron: 10306
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 37, index 10306) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a group project ensures everyone’s effort is recognized.

Token:  freely	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>The right to vote freely without intimidation safeguards individual liberty

Token:  integrity	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Body integrity—such integrity avoiding harmful

Token:  at	Activation: 10.0	Context:  practice any religion or none at all, without persecution.

Token:  citizens	Activation: 10.0	Context:  power is crucial so that citizens aren’t oppressed.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
