Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron (layer 37, index 10306) was initially thought to respond to tokens associated with themes of rights, personal freedom, and protection against oppression or harm, particularly in contexts related to individual autonomy and collective fairness. However, new evidence suggests that this neuron does not activate in response to these themes as previously believed.

1. **Unsupported Aspects:**
   - The original explanation suggested that the neuron activates on tokens directly referencing rights, protection, integrity, and participation in societal activities. However, test cases involving phrases like "right to express," "protect the integrity," "participating in the democratic process," and "collective fairness" resulted in zero activation. This indicates that the neuron does not respond to these specific themes or contexts.
   - The neuron was also thought to be sensitive to keywords and phrases underscoring autonomy, such as "freely" and "integrity," but test cases with these words did not trigger activation, suggesting that these keywords alone are not sufficient to activate the neuron.

2. **Modified Understanding:**
   - The neuron does not appear to respond to broad themes of rights, personal freedom, or protection against oppression, nor does it activate in contexts discussing legal, ethical, or societal principles related to these themes.
   - The lack of activation in contexts involving societal norms, regulations, and collective fairness suggests that the neuron is not sensitive to discussions about societal structures or collective identity.

3. **New Patterns or"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
