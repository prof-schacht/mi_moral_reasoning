=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 37, index 10306) responds to tokens associated with themes of rights, personal freedom, and protection against oppression or harm. The pattern it detects seems to focus on concepts related to individual autonomy and collective fairness, typically framed in a context of legal, ethical, or societal principles.

1. **Precise Pattern:**
   - The neuron activates on tokens that directly reference or imply rights, protection, integrity, and participation in societal activities. Frequently, these tokens appear in contexts discussing freedom, choice, and protection against negative forces or constraints.
   - Specifically, it seems to respond to keywords and phrases that underscore autonomy, such as "freely" and "integrity," or collective identity and protection, like "citizens."

2. **Contextual Accountability:**
   - In the context of the token "freely," the word is part of a phrase indicating the unhindered right to perform an act (e.g., voting). This suggests the neuron's sensitivity"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
