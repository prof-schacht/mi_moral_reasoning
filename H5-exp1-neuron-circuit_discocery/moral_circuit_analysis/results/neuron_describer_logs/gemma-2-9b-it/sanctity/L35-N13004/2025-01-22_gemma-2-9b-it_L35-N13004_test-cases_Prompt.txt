=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be detecting a pattern associated with concepts of fairness, equality, or justice, often in contexts related to social equity or moral judgments. We can infer this from the tokens and their contexts:

1. **Equal**: The activation occurs strongly on the word "equal" in the context of "equal opportunity," which directly pertains to themes of fairness and non-discrimination.
   
2. **Their**: The neuron activates on "their" in the phrase "their communities," implying a recognition of respect and possibly equality in self-determination within social groups.

3. **One**: The activation happens on "one" in "each have one vote," which signifies fairness in democratic processes, emphasizing the equal value of each vote.

4. **In**: The activation on "in" is part of "the aid of a stranger in distress," suggesting a recognition of altruistic, equitable behavior in social responsibilities and moral support.

5. **The**: The neuron responds strongly"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
