Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron primarily detects patterns related to the concept of equality, particularly in contexts involving tangible actions or policies that promote fairness and equal treatment. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Strong Activation on Concrete Equality Measures**: The neuron shows high activation levels in contexts where equality is explicitly tied to concrete actions or policies, such as "equal pay for equal work" and "equal access to education." These examples indicate that the neuron is particularly sensitive to discussions of equality that involve specific, actionable measures or rights.

2. **Moderate Activation on Community and Altruism**: The activation is moderate when the text involves community actions or altruistic behavior, such as "providing aid to those in need." This suggests that while the neuron does respond to themes of social support and altruism, it is less sensitive compared to direct equality measures.

3. **Democratic Processes**: The neuron also shows strong activation in contexts related to democratic principles, such as "each citizen was granted one vote," reinforcing its sensitivity to equality in representation and fairness in democratic processes.

4. **Low Activation on Abstract Social Justice**: The neuron exhibits low activation in contexts that discuss social justice in a more abstract or broad sense, such as "shaping policies that aimed to promote social justice." This indicates that the neuron is less responsive to general discussions of social justice unless they are tied to specific, concrete actions or policies.

5. **"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
