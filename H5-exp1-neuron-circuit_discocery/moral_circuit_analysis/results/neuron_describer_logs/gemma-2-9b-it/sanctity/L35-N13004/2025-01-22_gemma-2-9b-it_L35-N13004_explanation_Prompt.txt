Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 35, Neuron: 13004
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 35, index 13004) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  equal	Activation: 10.0	Context:  is unacceptable because it denies equal opportunity.

Token:  their	Activation: 10.0	Context: , should be respected within their communities.

Token:  one	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a committee should each have one vote to reflect equality.

Token:  in	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the aid of a stranger in distress.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context: Punishing tax fraud among the wealthy is just as important

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
