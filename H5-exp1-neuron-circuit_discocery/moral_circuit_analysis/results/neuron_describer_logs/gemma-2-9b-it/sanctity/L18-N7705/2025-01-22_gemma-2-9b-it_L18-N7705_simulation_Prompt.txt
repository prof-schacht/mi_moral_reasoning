Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron (layer 18, index 7705) demonstrates a nuanced sensitivity to concepts related to authority, governance, and legal frameworks, with a particular emphasis on the context in which these concepts are presented. The new evidence provides insights into specific patterns that trigger the neuron's activation:

1. **Authority and Governance-related Terms**: The original explanation correctly identifies that the neuron activates for terms like "authorities," "government," "judicial," and "punishment." However, the activation strength varies significantly based on the context in which these terms are used.

2. **Contextual Role and Specificity**:
   - **Regulatory and Enforcement Contexts**: The neuron shows strong activation (6.000) when terms are used in contexts directly involving regulation, enforcement, or legal integrity, as seen in the examples "Local authorities have imposed strict penalties..." and "Judicial reviews are essential...". This suggests a heightened sensitivity to scenarios where authority is actively engaged in maintaining order or justice.
   - **General Authority Contexts**: In contexts where authority is mentioned but not directly linked to enforcement or regulation, such as "The teacher's authority was questioned..." and "The government announced new regulations...", the activation is moderate (3.000). This indicates that the neuron's sensitivity decreases when the authority is more abstract or less directly involved in enforcement actions.
   - **Historical or Conceptual Contexts**: The neuron shows lower activation (2"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
