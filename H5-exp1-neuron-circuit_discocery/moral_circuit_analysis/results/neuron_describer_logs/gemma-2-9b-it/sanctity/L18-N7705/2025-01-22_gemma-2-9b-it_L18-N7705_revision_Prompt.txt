Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 18, index 7705) seems to be highly sensitive to concepts related to authority, governance, and legal frameworks. Let's break down the specific patterns triggering its activation based on the examples provided:

1. **Authority and Governance-related Terms**: The neuron activates strongly for words like "authorities," "government," "judicial," and "punishment." These terms are directly associated with structures or entities that enact, enforce, or uphold laws and regulations. The context typically involves passing legislation, ensuring compliance, or upholding societal norms.

2. **Contextual Role**: The activation occurs when these words are used in a context that highlights their role in regulation, control, enforcement, or the safeguarding of public order and safety. For example, "authorities" and "government" are engaged in setting regulations, "judicial" relates to the legal system's fairness and dignity, and "punishment" pertains to enforcement measures.

3. **Linguistic and"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The government announced new regulations to ensure the safety and compliance of all industrial sectors."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Local authorities have imposed strict penalties on those violating the public health guidelines."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Judicial reviews are essential to maintaining the integrity of the justice system and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The teacher's authority was questioned when students refused to follow the classroom rules he set."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The concept of punishment in ancient societies often involved severe physical penalties as a means of enforcing laws."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
