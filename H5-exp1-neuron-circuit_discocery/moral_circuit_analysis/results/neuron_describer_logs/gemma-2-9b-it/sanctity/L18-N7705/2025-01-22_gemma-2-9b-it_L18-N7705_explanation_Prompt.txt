Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 18, Neuron: 7705
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 18, index 7705) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  authorities	Activation: 10.0	Context: ying traffic laws set by authorities ensures public safety.

Token:  government	Activation: 10.0	Context:  traffic regulations set by the government for public safety.

Token:  judicial	Activation: 10.0	Context:  acknowledges the dignity of the judicial system.

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  true to a cause you’ve championed for years demonstrates

Token:  punishment	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the government without fear of punishment.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
