Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 18, Neuron: 883
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 18, index 883) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  or trade fosters personal autonomy.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  decisions, reflecting their authority.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  friends demonstrates a lasting bond.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  your community supports collective cohesion.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context: re injured demonstrates caring solidarity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
