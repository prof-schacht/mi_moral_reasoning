Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 32, Neuron: 10051
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 32, index 10051) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  individuals	Activation: 10.0	Context:  independence from state control allows individuals more freedom.

Token:  personnel	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Military personnel observing the personnel of command

Token:  about	Activation: 10.0	Context:  freedom to make personal choices about their bodies.

Token:  underpin	Activation: 10.0	Context:  association and freedom of assembly underpin a free society.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  they desire without state interference.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
