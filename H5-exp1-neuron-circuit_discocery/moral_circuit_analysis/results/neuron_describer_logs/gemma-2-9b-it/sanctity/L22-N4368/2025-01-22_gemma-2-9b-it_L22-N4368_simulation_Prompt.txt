Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Neuron 4368 in layer 22 demonstrates a nuanced responsiveness to linguistic patterns that convey obligation, necessity, and social expectations, particularly in contexts involving ethical or directive language. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of this neuron's activation patterns.

### Supported Aspects:
1. **Token Activation**:
   - The neuron continues to show activation on words like "is," "to," and "should," which are often used in contexts expressing obligation or normative judgments. This aligns with the original observation that these tokens contribute to statements about obligation or normative judgment.

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - **Ethical Judgments and Obligations**: The neuron activates strongly in contexts where there is a clear expression of obligation or ethical necessity, such as in the phrases "is essential," "is obligated," and "should be." These contexts often involve societal or ethical expectations, confirming the neuron's sensitivity to normative language.

### Modified Aspects:
1. **Focus on Specific Contexts**:
   - The original explanation emphasized ethical judgments and equality, but the new evidence suggests a broader focus on any context that involves a clear directive or necessity, not limited to equality or ethical judgments. For example, the activation in "to maintain societal harmony" and "sustainable practices are necessary" indicates responsiveness to broader societal obligations.

2. **Activation Intensity**:
   - The neuron shows varying levels of activation depending on the strength and clarity of the obligation"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
