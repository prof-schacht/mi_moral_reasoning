=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 4368 in layer 22 appears to be responsive to a particular linguistic pattern related to expressions of obligation, necessity, or social expectations, especially in contexts concerning ethical or directive language.

Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Token Activation**:
   - The neuron activates on words like "is," "to," "should," and unique syllables like "uph" that can suggest part of words with similar implications. This indicates a focus on words or segments that contribute to statements about obligation or normative judgment.

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - **Ethical Judgments and Equality**: In the context of "is," the phrase involves a normative claim ("ethnic discrimination in hiring is unacceptable"). Here, the sentence conveys a strong ethical stance, marking what is normatively right or wrong.
   - **Humanitarian Actions**: In the context with "uph," the phrase denotes upholding shared values or societal expectations ("lonely"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "It is essential for everyone to treat others with respect, as kindness should be the foundation of our interactions."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The company is obligated to provide equal opportunities to all employees, ensuring that discrimination is not tolerated."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "To maintain societal harmony, individuals ought to uphold the law and respect community values."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Should we consider the environmental impact of our actions, it becomes clear that sustainable practices are necessary for future generations."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "While it is widely accepted that honesty is the best policy, situations may arise where truth-telling is challenging."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
