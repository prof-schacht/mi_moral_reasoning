Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 31, Neuron: 9173
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 31, index 9173) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  drugs	Activation: 10.0	Context: , using performance-enhancing drugs undermines fair competition and should

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  must respect air traffic controllers’ instructions to maintain flight safety

Token:  sanctity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  solemn spaces upholds their sanctity.

Token: tions	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Performing ablutionstions religious ceremonies demonstrates purity

Token:  they	Activation: 10.0	Context:  police officers in emergencies because they are trained to handle crises

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
