=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 31, index 9173) appears to activate in response to specific linguistic patterns that often signify the end of a possessive or plural noun form, reference to sacredness, or entities within a structured context indicating rule or authority. Let’s break down the examples provided:

1. **Token: "drugs"**

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
