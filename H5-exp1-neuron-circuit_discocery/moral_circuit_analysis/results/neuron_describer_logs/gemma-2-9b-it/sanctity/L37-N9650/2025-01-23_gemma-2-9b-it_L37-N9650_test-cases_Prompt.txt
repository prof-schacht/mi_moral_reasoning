=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 37, index 9650) appears to be responding to linguistic patterns and concepts associated with rights, entitlements, or fairness, typically in contexts dealing with social norms, fairness, and personal liberties.

### Pattern Analysis:

1. **Activation Context with Definite Articles ("a"):**
   - The activations on the word "a" (e.g., "without extensive bureaucratic hurdles is a right" and "Owning private property is a hallmark of personal liberty") suggest that the neuron is detecting usage contexts involving the concept of rights or norms. Whenever "a" is used to introduce a widely acknowledged concept or principle right after discussing an issue or a general principle, it triggers strong activation.

2. **Activation with Child-Related Concepts:**
   - The token "child" and "childhood" activated at 10.0 are part of phrases like "Every child deserves emotional child and reassurance" and "Supporting your childhood sports childhood through losing seasons"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
