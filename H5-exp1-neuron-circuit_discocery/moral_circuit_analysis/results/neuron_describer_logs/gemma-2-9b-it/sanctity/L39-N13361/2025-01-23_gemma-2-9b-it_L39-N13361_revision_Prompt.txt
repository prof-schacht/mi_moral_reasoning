=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 39, index 13361) appears to activate in contexts that emphasize the concept or theme of responsibility, guidelines, or moral/ethical action. Let's break down the pattern observed in the given examples:

1. **Token: "integrity"**  
   - **Activation**: 10.0  
   - **Context**: "<bos>Body integrityâ€”such integrity avoiding harmful"  
   - **Analysis**: The neuron activates at "integrity," which is often associated with moral principles or honesty. The context suggests a focus on maintaining one's body integrity and avoiding harmful actions. This aligns with themes of respecting personal boundaries and ethical conduct.

2. **Token: "farm"**  
   - **Activation**: 10.0  
   - **Context**: "<bos>Adopting rescued farm farm to protect them from"  
   - **Analysis**: Here, the word "farm" appears in a context that suggests a responsibility towards"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The importance of honesty and transparency in leadership cannot be overstated, as integrity forms the backbone of ethical governance."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "She took it upon herself to ensure the safety of the wildlife sanctuary, demonstrating her commitment to conservation ethics."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In the face of adversity, he upheld his principles, choosing to act with integrity rather than succumbing to corruption."
Activation: 5.000

Activation: 2.000
Text: "As a parent, instilling a sense of moral duty and responsibility in children is crucial for their development into conscientious adults."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
