Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 39, Neuron: 13361
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 39, index 13361) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  integrity	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Body integrity—such integrity avoiding harmful

Token:  farm	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Adopting rescued farm farm to protect them from

Token:  air	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Pilots must respect air traffic controllers’ instructions to

Token:  all	Activation: 10.0	Context: Judges and referees should treat all participants impartially.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context: ’s privacy is loyal.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
