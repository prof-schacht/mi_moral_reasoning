Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 39, index 13361) appears to activate in contexts that emphasize the concept of integrity, ethical principles, and personal responsibility, but with varying degrees of activation depending on specific contextual cues. Let's refine the pattern based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Activation Patterns**:
   - The neuron shows a strong activation (10.0) in contexts where the concept of integrity is directly linked to personal boundaries and ethical conduct, as seen in the original example with "integrity" in the context of "Body integrityâ€”such integrity avoiding harmful."
   - However, in new test cases, the activation is notably lower (3.0) when "integrity" is mentioned in broader contexts of leadership and governance, suggesting that the neuron is more sensitive to personal or direct ethical actions rather than abstract or systemic applications.

2. **Responsibility and Ethical Action**:
   - The neuron activates moderately (3.0 to 5.0) in contexts where individuals demonstrate personal responsibility or ethical action, such as ensuring the safety of a wildlife sanctuary or upholding principles in adversity. This indicates that the neuron responds to personal commitment to ethical behavior, but the activation is not as strong as when integrity is directly mentioned in a personal context.

3. **Guidelines and Moral Duty**:
   - The activation is lower (2.0) when the context involves guidelines or general moral duty, such as workplace conduct or parenting responsibilities
