Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 32, index 1349) appears to respond to linguistic contexts involving interpersonal interactions and relational dynamics, specifically focusing on the nuances of social behavior and integrity. Based on the examples provided, here is the analysis:

1. **Social Hierarchies and Contextual Role**:
   - In the first example, the activation occurs with the word "meetings," which typically involves social hierarchies and decision-making processes. The phrase "to be heard first in meetings" implies an awareness of status or rank within a group setting.

2. **Offering Services or Support**:
   - The activations around the token "a" in the contexts "Offering a meal to" and "Offering a listening ear" suggest the neuron's emphasis on acts of support or service. These actions are related to nurturing social bonds or fulfilling societal roles of care and assistance.

3. **Trust and Betrayal**:
   - The example with "betrayal" in the context of"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: During the annual evaluation, the team leader emphasized the importance of everyone's "voice being heard" in the strategic planning meetings.
Activation: 3.000
Text: When she offered "a shoulder to cry on" after the unfortunate incident, it highlighted her genuine compassion and support.
Activation: 5.000
Text: The sudden "betrayal" by a long-trusted colleague left him questioning the integrity of all professional relationships.
Activation: 0.000
Text: In the boardroom, the director's "insistence on protocol" demonstrated the complex social hierarchies present in corporate environments.
Activation: 4.000
Text: As they discussed the "implications of trust" in their partnership, the underlying dynamics of mutual respect and potential deception were evident.
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
