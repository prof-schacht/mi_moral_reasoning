Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 32, index 1349) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  meetings	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to be heard first in meetings as part of the hierarchy

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Offering a meal to a who hasn

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Offering a listening ear a someone who
