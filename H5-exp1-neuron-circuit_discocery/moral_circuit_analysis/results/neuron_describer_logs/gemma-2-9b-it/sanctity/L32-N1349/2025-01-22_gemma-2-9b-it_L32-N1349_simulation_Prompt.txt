Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 32, index 1349) appears to respond to linguistic contexts involving interpersonal interactions, particularly focusing on the dynamics of support and social hierarchies. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Social Hierarchies and Protocols**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts involving social hierarchies and adherence to protocols, as seen in the example "insistence on protocol" with an activation of 4.000. This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to contexts where social roles and hierarchies are emphasized, such as "meetings" and "strategic planning meetings" with an activation of 3.000.

2. **Acts of Support and Compassion**:
   - The neuron exhibits high activation in contexts involving genuine acts of support and compassion, such as "a shoulder to cry on" with an activation of 5.000. This aligns with the original observation that the neuron responds to nurturing social bonds and acts of service, like "Offering a meal to" or "Offering a listening ear."

3. **Trust and Betrayal**:
   - Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate in contexts explicitly involving betrayal, as seen with "betrayal" having an activation of 0.000. This suggests that the neuron does not respond to themes of trust and betrayal as previously thought. Instead, it may focus more"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
