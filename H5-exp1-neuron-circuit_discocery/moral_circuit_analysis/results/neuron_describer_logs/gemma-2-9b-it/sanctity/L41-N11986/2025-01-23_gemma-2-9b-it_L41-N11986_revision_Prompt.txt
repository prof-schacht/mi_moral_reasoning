Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron's activations suggest that it detects concepts related to human virtues, specifically those associated with empathy, kindness, and social harmony. Let's break this down based on each example:

1. **Token: more (Activation: 10.0)**  
   Context: "coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment."  
   - "More" here is part of the phrase "more humane," indicating an increase in empathy or kindness within a work environment.

2. **Token: human (Activation: 10.0)**  
   Context: "in days is a basic human kindness."  
   - The term "human" is directly linked to "human kindness," explicitly highlighting empathy or compassion.

3. **Token: and (Activation: 10.0)**  
   Context: "before meals can express gratitude and sanctify nourishment."  
   - The conjunction "and" connects concepts of gratitude and sanctity, suggesting a theme of positive human values.

4. **"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Volunteering at the shelter fosters a more compassionate community spirit."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Apologizing sincerely can mend relationships and build trust."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The initiative to plant trees was not just about the environment, but about creating a legacy of kindness and care for future generations."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "Listening actively and responding empathetically are key to harmonious interactions."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Sharing resources during crises exemplifies the true essence of humanity."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
