=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron's activations suggest that it detects concepts related to human virtues, specifically those associated with empathy, kindness, and social harmony. Let's break this down based on each example:

1. **Token: more (Activation: 10.0)**  
   Context: "coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment."  
   - "More" here is part of the phrase "more humane," indicating an increase in empathy or kindness within a work environment.

2. **Token: human (Activation: 10.0)**  
   Context: "in days is a basic human kindness."  
   - The term "human" is directly linked to "human kindness," explicitly highlighting empathy or compassion.

3. **Token: and (Activation: 10.0)**  
   Context: "before meals can express gratitude and sanctify nourishment."  
   - The conjunction "and" connects concepts of gratitude and sanctity, suggesting a theme of positive human values.

4. **"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
