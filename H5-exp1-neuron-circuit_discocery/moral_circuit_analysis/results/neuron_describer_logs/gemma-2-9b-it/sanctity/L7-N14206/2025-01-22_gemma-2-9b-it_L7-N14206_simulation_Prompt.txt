Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 7, index 14206) is primarily responsive to linguistic patterns associated with the concept of "respect" and its related forms, particularly within contexts that emphasize its importance or value. The new evidence from test cases supports and refines the original understanding of this neuron's behavior, revealing specific patterns that trigger its activation:

1. **Core Activation by Respect-Related Words:**
   - The neuron consistently activates in response to the root word "respect" and its direct derivatives, such as "respects" and "respecting." This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to these specific lexical items, as seen in sentences like "She respects her elders" and "Respecting diverse opinions," where the activation levels are notably high (8.000 and 10.000, respectively).

2. **Sensitivity to Contextual Emphasis:**
   - The neuron shows heightened activation in contexts where respect is emphasized as a fundamental or core value, as demonstrated in the sentences "The act of respecting others is fundamental..." and "The company culture emphasizes respect..." with activation levels of 7.000 and 8.000. This suggests that the neuron is not only attuned to the presence of respect-related words but also to the contextual emphasis on respect as a significant concept.

3. **Recognition of Respect in Action and Outcome:**
   - The neuron responds strongly to contexts where respect is portrayed as an action or outcome, such as "He gained respect"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
