=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron (layer 7, index 14206) appears to respond strongly to linguistic patterns associated with the concept of "respect" and its related forms, often within a specific grammatical or contextual construction. Based on the provided examples, there are a few distinct patterns that seem to trigger its activation:

1. **Respect-Related Root Words:**
   - The examples show that the neuron activates at tokens directly tied to "respect," such as "respect" and "respects." This indicates that the neuron is finely tuned to detect this root word in different grammatical forms, recognizing its semantic and syntactic significance in sentences.

2. **Continuous and Derivative Forms:**
   - The neuron also activates at the suffix "ing," particularly when it is part of gerund forms derived from "respect" (e.g., "Respecting"). This suggests the neuron is sensitive to ongoing actions or states associated with respect, highlighting its role in detecting verb forms.

3. **Contextual Emphasis on
