Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 27, Neuron: 1709
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 27, index 1709) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  free	Activation: 10.0	Context:  sacred rivers by keeping them free from pollutants demonstrates reverence.

Token:  if	Activation: 10.0	Context:  team at work, even if theyâ€™re tough,

Token:  during	Activation: 10.0	Context:  deserves emotional support and reassurance during hard times.

Token:  during	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to check on elderly neighbors during severe weather is morally right

Token: '	Activation: 10.0	Context: Remembering and celebrating a friend's birthday is a small

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
