=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 27, index 1709) appears to activate in response to tokens that imply conditions or scenarios associated with a moral or ethical undertone, as well as the context of support or freedom. Let's break down the activation pattern:

1. **Conditional Language**: The neuron's activation on the token "if" suggests it might respond to conditional constructs that often imply a hypothetical or evaluative scenario, which might suggest some form of moral or ethical deliberation. This is supported by the context "even if they’re tough," indicating a conditional state that could be judged or evaluated based on moral considerations (e.g., perseverance or resilience despite challenges).

2. **Temporal Contexts**: The activations on "during" are notable in contexts that imply supportive actions during specific events or times, such as "during hard times" and "during severe weather." This suggests an emphasis on context-sensitive, often compassionate or duty-driven actions evaluated on moral grounds — providing support in challenging"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
