Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 10710
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 10710) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context:  ensures everyoneâ€™s effort is recognized.

Token:  basic	Activation: 10.0	Context:  loss is a sign of basic human compassion.

Token:  duty	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the homeless is our fundamental duty.

Token:  basic	Activation: 10.0	Context:  eaten in days is a basic human kindness.

Token:  right	Activation: 10.0	Context:  extensive bureaucratic hurdles is a right.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
