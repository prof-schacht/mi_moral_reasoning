Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to be sensitive to contexts involving fairness, equality, personal choice, and structural accommodation, as seen in the examples provided. Let’s analyze the pattern that triggers its activation:

1. **Conjunction or Emphasis on Equality or Fair Share**:
   - In the context "Students who cheat on undermine equal opportunity and," the neuron is responding to the idea of undermining equality. The token "on" here may not directly hold significant meaning alone but fits into a broader pattern where "cheat on" and "undermine equal opportunity" are connected.
  
   - Similarly, in "credit fairly for a group project ensures everyone’s effort," the neuron activates likely because the context emphasizes equitable distribution of credit or recognition in a group setting.

2. **Supportive or Flexible Structures**:
   - The activation on "flexible" in "Providing flexible scheduling for flexible parents supports" suggests responsiveness to phrases where policies or systems adjust to accommodate diverse needs, underlining adaptability as"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
