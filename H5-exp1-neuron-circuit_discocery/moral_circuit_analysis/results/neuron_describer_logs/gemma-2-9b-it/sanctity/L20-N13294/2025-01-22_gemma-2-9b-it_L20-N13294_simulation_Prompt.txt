Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 20, index 13294) demonstrates a nuanced responsiveness to linguistic patterns involving certain prepositions, phrasal verbs, and gerunds, as well as the presence of function words that indicate purpose or action. The new evidence suggests a more refined understanding of the neuron's activation triggers:

1. **Prepositions and Purpose Indicators:**
   - The neuron's activation is notably high in contexts where prepositions like "for" are used to indicate purpose or target, as seen in the original example and supported by the test case "The book was written for children, aiming to educate and entertain simultaneously" (Activation: 2.000). This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to contexts where prepositions define the purpose or goal of an action.

2. **Phrasal Verbs and Movement:**
   - The word "out" in phrasal verbs or indicating movement, such as "Reaching out to the community was crucial for the success of the event" (Activation: 7.000), triggers a strong response. This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to phrasal verbs and actions involving outreach or extension.

3. **Gerunds and Continuous Actions:**
   - The neuron's activation in contexts involving gerunds, such as "Applying lessons learned from the conference" (Activation: 1.000) and "Walking through the serene forest" (Activation: 4.000), suggests a responsiveness to continuous or"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
