=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 39, index 2358) appears to activate in response to concepts related to principles of fairness, truth, and integrity within contexts that imply ethical considerations or moral standards. Here’s a breakdown of the pattern that triggers activation:

1. **Activation on "truth" and "fair"**:
   - The neuron activates strongly on words like "truth" and "fair" that are directly tied to concepts of honesty and equity. These words are central to discussions of ethical standards or principles.
   - Contexts such as “a marketplace of ideas where truth can emerge” and “ensures fair competition” indicate scenarios involving the pursuit of equitable outcomes or the revelation of genuine facts, reinforcing themes of integrity and fairness.

2. **Activation on "-" (hyphen)**:
   - The hyphen appears in contexts where it connects phrases that imply a balance or alignment with moral actions, such as "long supported" despite challenges or endeavors for noble causes like covering medical costs."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
