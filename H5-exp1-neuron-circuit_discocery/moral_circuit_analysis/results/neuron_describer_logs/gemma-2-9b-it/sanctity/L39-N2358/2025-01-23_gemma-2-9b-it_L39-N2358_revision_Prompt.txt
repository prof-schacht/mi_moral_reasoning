=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 39, index 2358) appears to activate in response to concepts related to principles of fairness, truth, and integrity within contexts that imply ethical considerations or moral standards. Here’s a breakdown of the pattern that triggers activation:

1. **Activation on "truth" and "fair"**:
   - The neuron activates strongly on words like "truth" and "fair" that are directly tied to concepts of honesty and equity. These words are central to discussions of ethical standards or principles.
   - Contexts such as “a marketplace of ideas where truth can emerge” and “ensures fair competition” indicate scenarios involving the pursuit of equitable outcomes or the revelation of genuine facts, reinforcing themes of integrity and fairness.

2. **Activation on "-" (hyphen)**:
   - The hyphen appears in contexts where it connects phrases that imply a balance or alignment with moral actions, such as "long supported" despite challenges or endeavors for noble causes like covering medical costs."

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The judge emphasized the importance of truth and fairness in the courtroom, ensuring that justice would be served without bias."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In a fair election, every vote must count equally - no matter the region or demographic, reflecting the core democratic principles."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "John believed in truthfully reporting his findings, even when it meant challenging the status quo in the scientific community."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "A company that promotes fair trade ensures that its workers are treated with integrity - receiving just wages and humane working conditions."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The panel discussed how transparency and truth in advertising are crucial for maintaining consumer trust."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
