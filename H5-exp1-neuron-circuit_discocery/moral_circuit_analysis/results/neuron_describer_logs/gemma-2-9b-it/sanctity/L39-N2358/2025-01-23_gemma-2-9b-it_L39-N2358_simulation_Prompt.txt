Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron (layer 39, index 2358) activates in response to concepts related to principles of truth, fairness, and integrity, particularly within contexts that emphasize ethical considerations or moral standards. The new evidence provides additional insights into the specific patterns that trigger this neuron:

1. **Activation on "truth" and "fair"**:
   - The neuron consistently activates strongly on words like "truth" and "fair," confirming the original explanation that these words are central to discussions of ethical standards. The test cases show that contexts involving justice, equality, and transparency, such as "truth and fairness in the courtroom" and "truthfully reporting findings," trigger strong activation, reinforcing the neuron's sensitivity to themes of honesty and equity.

2. **Activation on ethical contexts**:
   - The neuron activates in scenarios that emphasize ethical principles, such as "ensuring justice without bias" and "transparency and truth in advertising." These contexts highlight the neuron's focus on maintaining integrity and ethical standards, supporting the original explanation.

3. **Activation on "-" (hyphen)**:
   - The original explanation suggested that the hyphen triggers activation when connecting phrases implying moral actions. However, the new evidence shows that the hyphen itself does not consistently trigger strong activation. For example, in "fair trade ensures that its workers are treated with integrity - receiving just wages," the activation is lower (1.000), indicating that the presence of a hyphen is not"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
