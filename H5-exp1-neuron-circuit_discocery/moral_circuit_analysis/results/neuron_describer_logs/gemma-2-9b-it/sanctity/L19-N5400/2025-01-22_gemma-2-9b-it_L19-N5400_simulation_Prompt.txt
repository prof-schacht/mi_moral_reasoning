Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in layer 19, index 5400, appears to activate in contexts involving themes related to morality, values, or principles, but with a more nuanced sensitivity than initially described. The original explanation suggested a strong activation in contexts explicitly discussing moral principles or ethical behaviors. However, the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation is more moderate and selective, responding to specific linguistic cues within these themes.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron does activate in contexts related to morality, values, or principles, as seen in both the original and new examples. The presence of moral or ethical language, such as "should," "principle," and "values," continues to be relevant.

2. **Aspects to Modify or Remove**:
   - The original explanation suggested a high activation level (10.0) for contexts involving moral principles. However, the new evidence shows that the neuron's activation is generally lower (ranging from 1.0 to 4.0) even in clear moral contexts. This indicates that the neuron does not uniformly respond with high activation to all moral or ethical discussions.
   - The specific focus on language structures expressing human values or ethical behaviors needs refinement. The neuron does not activate strongly for all instances of moral language, suggesting it may be sensitive to additional contextual factors or specific linguistic patterns.

3. **New Patterns or Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows moderate activation in contexts where moral"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
