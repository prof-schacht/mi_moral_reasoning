=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 19, index 5400, appears to activate in contexts involving themes related to morality, values, or principles. Let's delve into each example to pinpoint the specific pattern that triggers its activation:

1. **Token: "re" in "they’re"** - Activation: 10.0
   - Context: "household tasks when they’re injured demonstrates caring solidarity."
   - **Analysis**: The activation occurs in the context of discussing actions that illustrate moral principles such as caring and solidarity. The neuron seems sensitive to language structures expressing human values or ethical behaviors related to community and support.

2. **Token: "should"** - Activation: 10.0
   - Context: "Adults should have the should to make."
   - **Analysis**: The word "should" introduces an obligation or recommendation, often tied to moral expectations or normative claims. This aligns with the neuron's pattern of activating in contexts of moral"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
