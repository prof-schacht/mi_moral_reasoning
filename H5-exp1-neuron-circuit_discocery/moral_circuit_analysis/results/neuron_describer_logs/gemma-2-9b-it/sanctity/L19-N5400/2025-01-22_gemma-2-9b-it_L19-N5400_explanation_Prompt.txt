Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 5400
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 5400) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: re	Activation: 10.0	Context:  household tasks when theyâ€™re injured demonstrates caring solidarity.

Token:  should	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Adults should have the should to make

Token:  religions	Activation: 10.0	Context: ing fasting traditions in some religions reflects a commitment to purity

Token:  by	Activation: 10.0	Context: uing human bodies as temples by avoiding harmful drug abuse respects

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  honors the sanctity of nature.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
