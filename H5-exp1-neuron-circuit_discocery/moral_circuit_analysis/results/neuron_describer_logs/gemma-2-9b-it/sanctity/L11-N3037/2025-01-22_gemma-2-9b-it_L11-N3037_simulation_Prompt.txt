Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 11, index 3037) is responsive to linguistic elements that serve as syntactic connectors or structural markers, particularly in contexts that involve formal, declarative, or significant statements. The neuron's activation is influenced by the presence of certain conjunctions, prepositions, and punctuation marks that contribute to the structural complexity or importance of a sentence. Let's break down the activation pattern based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Conjunctions and Prepositions**: The neuron shows strong activation in sentences where conjunctions like "and" and prepositions like "of" are used to connect significant or complex ideas. For example, in "The principles of democracy and freedom, as well as equality, have been the cornerstone of our society," the high activation (7.000) suggests that the neuron is responsive to the conjunctions and prepositions that link important societal concepts.

2. **Punctuation as Structural Markers**: The neuron is also activated by punctuation that delineates significant structural boundaries or lists within a sentence. The high activation in "The treaty was signed in Paris on July 14th, 1789, marking a significant political shift." (10.000) indicates that the neuron is sensitive to commas and periods that separate and conclude important historical information.

3. **Contextual Importance**: The neuron is less responsive to sentences where the structural elements do not contribute to a broader, significant context. For instance,"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
