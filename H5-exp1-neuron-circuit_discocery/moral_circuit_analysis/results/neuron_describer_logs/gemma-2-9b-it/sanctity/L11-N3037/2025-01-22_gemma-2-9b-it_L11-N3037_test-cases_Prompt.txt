=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 11, index 3037) appears to be responsive to linguistic elements that serve as syntactic connectors or structural markers in a sentence, often within formal or declarative contexts. Let's break down the activation pattern based on each example:

1. **Token: "of"** - Activation occurs in the phrase "a committee of each have." Here, "of" serves as a prepositional connector within a formal or structured description.

2. **Token: "and"** - The activation in "association and and of assembly" shows responsiveness to "and" as a conjunction, which links elements within a formal or descriptive list or phrase.

3. **Token: ","** - Within "natural wonders,, pristine forests," the comma acts as a structural pause that separates items in a descriptive sequence, implying enumeration or continuation.

4. **Token: "."** - In "sites keeps ancestral heritage intact.", the period is a textual boundary marker, signaling the end of a complete"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
