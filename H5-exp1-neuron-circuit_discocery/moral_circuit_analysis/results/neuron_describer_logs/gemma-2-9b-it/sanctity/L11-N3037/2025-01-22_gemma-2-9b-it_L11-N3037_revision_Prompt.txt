Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 11, index 3037) appears to be responsive to linguistic elements that serve as syntactic connectors or structural markers in a sentence, often within formal or declarative contexts. Let's break down the activation pattern based on each example:

1. **Token: "of"** - Activation occurs in the phrase "a committee of each have." Here, "of" serves as a prepositional connector within a formal or structured description.

2. **Token: "and"** - The activation in "association and and of assembly" shows responsiveness to "and" as a conjunction, which links elements within a formal or descriptive list or phrase.

3. **Token: ","** - Within "natural wonders,, pristine forests," the comma acts as a structural pause that separates items in a descriptive sequence, implying enumeration or continuation.

4. **Token: "."** - In "sites keeps ancestral heritage intact.", the period is a textual boundary marker, signaling the end of a complete"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The principles of democracy and freedom, as well as equality, have been the cornerstone of our society."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "In the meeting, the agenda covered topics of finance, marketing, and strategy."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The book was old, dusty, and missing pages, yet it held the key to understanding the past."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "To bake the cake, you will need flour, sugar, and eggs."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The treaty was signed in Paris on July 14th, 1789, marking a significant political shift."
Activation: 10.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
