Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron primarily responds to linguistic patterns associated with the concept of freedom from restriction, particularly in contexts where autonomy is emphasized. However, the neuron's response to obligation or necessity is more nuanced than initially described. Let's refine the activation patterns based on the new evidence:

1. **Patterns of Activation Related to Autonomy and Lack of Restriction:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation when the text implies freedom from control or the absence of hindrance, as seen in the example "Employees can work from home without needing approval from their managers," which received a high activation score of 10.000. This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to contexts suggesting autonomy or lack of restriction.

2. **Limited Response to Obligation or Necessity:**
   - Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not strongly activate in contexts where obligation or necessity is emphasized. For instance, sentences like "Students must complete their assignments by the deadline to receive a grade" and "Residents must be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities" received low activation scores of 1.000 and 2.000, respectively. This indicates that the neuron's response to the token "must" is not as pronounced as initially thought, especially when the context is strictly about obligation without a contrasting element of freedom.

3. **Contextual Nuances:**
   - The neuron appears to be more sensitive to contexts where freedom or autonomy is explicitly contrasted with potential restrictions,"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
