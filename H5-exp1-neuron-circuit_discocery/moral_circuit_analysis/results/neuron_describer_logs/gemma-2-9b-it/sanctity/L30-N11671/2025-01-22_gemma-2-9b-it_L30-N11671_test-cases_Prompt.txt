=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to linguistic patterns related to conditionality and necessity, particularly within contexts that involve freedom, obligation, or absence of hindrance. Let's break down the activation patterns based on the given examples:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron strongly activates on tokens like "approval" and "without" when they appear in contexts suggesting a lack of restriction or the presence of autonomy, as in "forms of recreation without government approval" and "to any region they desire without state interference." The emphasis appears to be on the negation of authority or control, highlighting the idea of freedom or lack of hurdles.

2. **Tokens Suggesting Obligation or Necessity:**
   - The neuron activates on the token "must" in sentences like "<bos>Citizens must be free must join or" and "<bos>People must be held must for breaking." Here, "must" is used in its sense of obligation or necessity. The repetition in "must be free"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
