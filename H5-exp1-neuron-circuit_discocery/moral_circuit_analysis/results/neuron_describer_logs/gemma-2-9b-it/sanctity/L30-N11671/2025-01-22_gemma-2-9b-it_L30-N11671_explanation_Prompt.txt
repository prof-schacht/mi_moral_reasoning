Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 30, Neuron: 11671
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 30, index 11671) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  approval	Activation: 10.0	Context:  forms of recreation without government approval.

Token:  without	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to any region they desire without state interference.

Token:  without	Activation: 10.0	Context:  free to criticize the government without fear of punishment.

Token:  must	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Citizens must be free must join or

Token:  must	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>People must be held must for breaking

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
