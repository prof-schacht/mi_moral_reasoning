Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, it appears that the neuron in layer 40, index 11193 consistently shows an activation score of 0.0 across various contexts and tokens. This suggests that the neuron is not triggered by certain types of linguistic or semantic features. Here's a refined understanding of what this neuron does and does not respond to:

1. **Lack of Response to Descriptive or Poetic Language:**
   - The new evidence includes sentences with vivid imagery and descriptive language (e.g., "flames danced wildly," "ethereal beauty," "profound silence"), yet the neuron remains inactive. This suggests that the neuron does not respond to descriptive or poetic language, which often carries emotional or aesthetic significance.

2. **Neutrality to Contextual Complexity:**
   - The sentences provided in the new evidence are contextually rich and complex, involving themes of innovation, perseverance, and beauty. Despite this complexity, the neuron does not activate, indicating that it is not sensitive to the richness or depth of context.

3. **Indifference to Emotional or Dramatic Content:**
   - The examples include emotionally charged or dramatic scenarios (e.g., "overwhelming odds," "achieving the impossible"), yet the neuron does not activate. This suggests that the neuron is indifferent to emotional intensity or dramatic narratives.

4. **Confirmation of Non-Response to Syntactic Irregularities:**
   - The original observation that the neuron"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
