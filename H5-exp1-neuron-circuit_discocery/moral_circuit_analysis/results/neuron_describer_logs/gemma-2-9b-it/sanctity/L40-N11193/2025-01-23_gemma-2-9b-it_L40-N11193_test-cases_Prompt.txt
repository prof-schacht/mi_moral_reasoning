Prompt Type: test-cases

=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, where the neuron in layer 40, index 11193 shows activation with a score of 0.0, it seems that this neuron is not strongly activated by any specific tokens or contexts in these particular examples.

However, rather than indicating what the neuron positively responds to, examining these zero activation examples might hint at what this neuron does not respond to. From these examples, no activation is triggered for:

1. **Positions within Words:** The neuron doesn't respond to tokens that seem like part of a larger word, suggesting it might not be looking for beginnings or ends of complete words since partially-formed words (e.g., "refraining fromfra") don't activate it.

2. **Neutral Contexts:** The contexts surrounding the tokens are neutral or carry standard, everyday meanings. This might indicate that the neuron isn't interested in neutral or overly common concepts.

3. **Syntactic Irregularities or Continuations:** Half-formed words or syntax (e.g"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
