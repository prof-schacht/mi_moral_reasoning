Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 40, Neuron: 11193
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 40, index 11193) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  an	Activation: 0.0	Context: <bos>Stopping to help an an animal on the road

Token:  imparti	Activation: 0.0	Context:  referees should treat all participants impartially.

Token:  at	Activation: 0.0	Context: arily submitting to lawful search at security checkpoints maintains collective safety

Token: fra	Activation: 0.0	Context: <bos>Refraining fromfra gossip about

Token:  gradu	Activation: 0.0	Context: s important milestones, like graduations or weddings, is

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
