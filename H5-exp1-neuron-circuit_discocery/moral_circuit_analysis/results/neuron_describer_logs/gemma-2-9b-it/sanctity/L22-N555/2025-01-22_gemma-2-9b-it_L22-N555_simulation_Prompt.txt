Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 22, index 555) appears to activate in response to specific linguistic patterns that involve syntactically complex sentences, particularly those that emphasize adaptability, causality, or future-oriented constructs. Let's refine our understanding based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Tokens Indicating Adaptability and Future Orientation:**
   - The neuron shows high activation in sentences that emphasize adaptability or future-oriented actions, as seen in "the capacity to adapt quickly to new tools and platforms is crucial for success" and "the proposal to allocate more funds to education was met with enthusiasm." These sentences highlight the importance of adapting to change or planning for future benefits, suggesting that the neuron is sensitive to constructs that involve forward-thinking or adaptability.

2. **Causal and Relational Constructs:**
   - The neuron activates in sentences that establish causal relationships or highlight the potential for future outcomes, such as "the study suggests that meditation can reduce stress, it also highlights the need for further research." This indicates that the neuron is responsive to constructs that involve causality or the need for further action or research.

3. **Non-activation in Simple Conditional or Possibility Constructs:**
   - Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate in sentences that merely express potentiality or possibility without a strong emphasis on adaptability or future orientation, as seen in "The ability to think critically can significantly improve decision-making skills" and "Introducing new policies to"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
