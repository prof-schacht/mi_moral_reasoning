Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 22, Neuron: 555
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 22, index 555) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  can	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to those who are anxious can reduce their distress.

Token: '	Activation: 10.0	Context:  coworkers to rest when they're ill helps prevent further

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  from unfair criticism reinforces trust.

Token:  gossip	Activation: 10.0	Context: Refraining from negative gossip about friends upholds loyalty

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  lifestyle can reflect a commitment to purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
