=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 22, index 555) appears to activate in response to specific linguistic patterns commonly found in syntactically complex sentences that involve relational or causal constructs. Let's break down this observation further based on the given examples:

1. **Tokens as Connectors or Hedgers:** 
   - The high activation on the token "can" in the context of "to those who are anxious can reduce their distress" suggests that the neuron is responsive to auxiliary verbs that denote potentiality or possibility. This usage often helps in forming conditional structures or propositions about actions or behaviors.
   - Similarly, the activation on both the token "to" in "lifestyle can reflect a commitment to purity" and "to" in "coworkers to rest when they're ill helps prevent further" indicates responsiveness to prepositional connectors that introduce clauses explaining purpose, result, or intent.

2. **Punctuation and Boundary Indicators:**
   - Activation on the token "." as seen in "from"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
