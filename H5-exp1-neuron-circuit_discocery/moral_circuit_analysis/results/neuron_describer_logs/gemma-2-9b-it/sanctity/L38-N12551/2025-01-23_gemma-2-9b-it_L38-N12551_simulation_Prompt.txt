Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence, the behavior of neuron (layer 38, index 12551) appears to be more nuanced than initially described. The neuron activates in response to specific linguistic contexts that emphasize principles and integrity, but with a particular focus on certain contexts and keywords. Let's break down the revised activation patterns:

1. **Token Specificity**: The neuron continues to activate on tokens that are not inherently significant, such as "be," but it shows a strong response to the word "bribes," indicating a sensitivity to contexts involving ethical breaches. The activation on "bribes" in the context of refusing them supports the idea that the neuron responds to explicit mentions of unethical behavior.

2. **Contextual Integrity and Fairness**: The neuron does not uniformly activate in all contexts related to integrity and fairness. The new evidence suggests that the neuron is more sensitive to contexts where integrity is explicitly contrasted with unethical behavior, rather than general statements about fairness or ethical principles:
   - **High Activation**: The neuron shows high activation in contexts where integrity is directly opposed to unethical actions, such as refusing bribes or following military orders with discipline.
   - **Low Activation**: The neuron does not activate strongly in contexts that discuss fairness or ethical principles in a more abstract or general sense, such as the board of directors' commitment to transparency or reporting corruption due to personal beliefs in justice.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
