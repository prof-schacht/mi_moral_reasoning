Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron (layer 38, index 12551) appears to activate in response to linguistic contexts that emphasize principles, integrity, and fairness, often within structured or formal statements. Let's break down the activation patterns:

1. **Token Specificity**: The neuron activates on tokens that, by themselves, are not particularly significant (such as "be," "is," "or"), but it notably activates on the word "bribes," which is more content-focused. This indicates the neuron might respond to subtle semantic cues rather than just explicit content words.

2. **Contextual Integrity and Fairness**: The examples recurrently feature contexts associated with principles of fairness or integrity:
   - **"bribes"**: Connected with a statement about refusing to take bribes, aligning with ethical principles.
   - **"be"**: Found within a statement about military orders, which suggests a context of discipline or structure.
   - **"land"**: Used"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
