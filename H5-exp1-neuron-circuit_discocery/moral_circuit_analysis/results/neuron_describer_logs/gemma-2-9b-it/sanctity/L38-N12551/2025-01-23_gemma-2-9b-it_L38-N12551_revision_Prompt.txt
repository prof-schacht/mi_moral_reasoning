=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron (layer 38, index 12551) appears to activate in response to linguistic contexts that emphasize principles, integrity, and fairness, often within structured or formal statements. Let's break down the activation patterns:

1. **Token Specificity**: The neuron activates on tokens that, by themselves, are not particularly significant (such as "be," "is," "or"), but it notably activates on the word "bribes," which is more content-focused. This indicates the neuron might respond to subtle semantic cues rather than just explicit content words.

2. **Contextual Integrity and Fairness**: The examples recurrently feature contexts associated with principles of fairness or integrity:
   - **"bribes"**: Connected with a statement about refusing to take bribes, aligning with ethical principles.
   - **"be"**: Found within a statement about military orders, which suggests a context of discipline or structure.
   - **"land"**: Used"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The judge emphasized the importance of maintaining integrity within the legal system and refused to accept any bribes."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "In the military, one must always be ready to follow orders with discipline and uphold the code of honor."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The board of directors unanimously agreed that transparency and fairness should guide all their decisions."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "She decided to report the corruption because she believed deeply in the principles of justice and fairness."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The committee was tasked with ensuring that every member adhered strictly to the ethical guidelines set forth."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
