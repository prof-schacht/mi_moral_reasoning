=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron at layer 14, index 4891, appears to respond strongly to tokens situated at the conclusion or near a transition point in a clause or sentence, particularly when the context involves principles, ideals, or actions connected to moral or ethical behaviors.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Activation on Sentence Terminals ("." token):**
   - In the examples where the token is a period ".", the neuron activates when there is a concluding statement that solidifies or emphasizes a principle or valueâ€”such as "imbue relationships with reverence" or "solemn respect preserves their meaning." These statements often reinforce completion of a thought that revolves around maintaining a virtue or positive action.

2. **Prepositions and Conjunctions ("on", "of" tokens):**
