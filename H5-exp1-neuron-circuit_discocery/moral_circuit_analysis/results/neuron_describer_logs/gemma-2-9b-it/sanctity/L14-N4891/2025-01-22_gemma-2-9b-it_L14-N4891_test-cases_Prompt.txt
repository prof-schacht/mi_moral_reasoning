=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 14, index 4891, appears to respond strongly to tokens situated at the conclusion or near a transition point in a clause or sentence, particularly when the context involves principles, ideals, or actions connected to moral or ethical behaviors.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Activation on Sentence Terminals ("." token):**
   - In the examples where the token is a period ".", the neuron activates when there is a concluding statement that solidifies or emphasizes a principle or valueâ€”such as "imbue relationships with reverence" or "solemn respect preserves their meaning." These statements often reinforce completion of a thought that revolves around maintaining a virtue or positive action.

2. **Prepositions and Conjunctions ("on", "of" tokens):**
   - The activations on prepositions like "on" and "of" seem to occur when these words are integral to phrases describing conditions of fairness or justice, such as "Awarding scholarships strictly"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
