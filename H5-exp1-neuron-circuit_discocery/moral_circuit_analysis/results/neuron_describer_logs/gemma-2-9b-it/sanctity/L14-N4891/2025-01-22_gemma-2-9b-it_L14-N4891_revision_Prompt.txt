=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 14, index 4891, appears to respond strongly to tokens situated at the conclusion or near a transition point in a clause or sentence, particularly when the context involves principles, ideals, or actions connected to moral or ethical behaviors.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Activation on Sentence Terminals ("." token):**
   - In the examples where the token is a period ".", the neuron activates when there is a concluding statement that solidifies or emphasizes a principle or valueâ€”such as "imbue relationships with reverence" or "solemn respect preserves their meaning." These statements often reinforce completion of a thought that revolves around maintaining a virtue or positive action.

2. **Prepositions and Conjunctions ("on", "of" tokens):**
   - The activations on prepositions like "on" and "of" seem to occur when these words are integral to phrases describing conditions of fairness or justice, such as "Awarding scholarships strictly"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The foundation of trust in any relationship is honesty and transparency, which ultimately secures the bond."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "She argued for justice on behalf of those who couldn't speak for themselves, demonstrating true compassion."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Excellence in academia is achieved through perseverance and dedication; this principle guides all successful students."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "A commitment to ethical practices in business is essential; it protects both the company and the community it serves."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The cat sat on the mat, pondering its next move."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
