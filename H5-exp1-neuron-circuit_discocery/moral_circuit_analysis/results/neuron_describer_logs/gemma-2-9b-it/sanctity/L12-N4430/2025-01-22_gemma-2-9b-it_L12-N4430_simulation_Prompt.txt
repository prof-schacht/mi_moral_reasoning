Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron is primarily responsive to linguistic constructs that emphasize perseverance, determination, and notable qualities in the face of challenges or contrasting situations. The new evidence suggests a refined understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Conditional or Concessive Constructs**: The neuron shows strong activation with constructs that highlight perseverance or determination despite adverse conditions. For example, "Even when the odds were against her, she persisted with unwavering determination" results in high activation (5.000), supporting the neuron's sensitivity to clauses that emphasize persistence against challenges. Similarly, "Despite the challenges, he remained optimistic and focused on his goals" also triggers significant activation (3.000), reinforcing this pattern.

2. **Contrast and Emphasis**: While the original explanation suggested sensitivity to contrastive conjunctions like "but," the new evidence indicates a lower activation (1.000) in the context of "It's not just a hobby, but a passion that drives him to achieve excellence." This suggests that the neuron is less responsive to simple contrasts and more attuned to contrasts that involve perseverance or overcoming difficulties.

3. **Descriptors of Notable Qualities**: The neuron appears to respond to descriptions that highlight notable qualities in challenging contexts. For instance, "The book, while lengthy, captures the reader's attention from start to finish" shows moderate activation (3.000), indicating sensitivity to descriptions that emphasize sustained engagement or interest despite potential drawbacks.

In summary, the neuron is most responsive"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
