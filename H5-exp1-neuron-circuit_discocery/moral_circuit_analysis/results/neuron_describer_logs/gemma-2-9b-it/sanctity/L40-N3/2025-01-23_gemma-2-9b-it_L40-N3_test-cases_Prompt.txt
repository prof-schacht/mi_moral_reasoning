=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the data provided, the neuron at layer 40, index 3, seems to activate at a high level for tokens related to roles or entities that are part of a structured, or organized social or hierarchical context. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the pattern it detects:

1. **Role or Entity Recognition**: The neuron activates for words that denote distinct roles or entities such as "neighbors," "family," "friend," "chain," and "flight." These words are central to their respective contexts, serving as key identifiers of structured interactions within a larger system.

2. **Context of Social or Organizational Frameworks**: The context in which these tokens appear suggests that they often reside within frameworks of cooperation, support, tradition, authority, or coordination:
   - "Neighbors" and "family" occur in contexts emphasizing social support and intergenerational continuity.
   - "Friend" is noted in a scenario of loyalty and social solidarity.
   - "Chain" is related to a command"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
