=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 27, index 12972, appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with concepts of fairness, equality, and communal or shared experiences. Let's break down each element that contributes to this neuron's activation:

1. **Token-Specific Observation**:
    - Tokens like "shared" and "return" are recurrent themes that heavily influence activation. These words are often used in contexts implying mutual benefit, reciprocity, or distribution among people.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
    - Contexts that frequently include the concept of equity or sharing resources among groups, such as "feels lonely upholds our shared humanity" and "business partners fairly fosters long-term trust," suggest that the neuron is sensitive to language expressing collective engagement or distribution.

3. **Activation Conditions**:
    - The neuron activates strongly in sentences that emphasize the distribution or balancing of resources or benefits, indicated by keywords like "shared" in various expressions and actions (e.g., "sharing credit," ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The community garden project thrives on shared responsibilities, ensuring everyone contributes and benefits equally."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "After years of collaboration, the partners decided to share their profits equally, reinforcing their mutual trust and respect."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In our world, the concept of fairness is often challenged, yet it remains a cornerstone of our shared human experience."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Despite the competition, the team agreed to share the credit for the project's success, recognizing each member's contribution."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "While the idea of sharing resources is noble, it often encounters resistance in practice, especially in competitive environments."
Activation: 8.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
