=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be responding to tokens related to ethical or moral concepts, particularly those involving fairness, honesty, and respect for others. Let's break down the observations:

1. **Pattern Focus**: The neuron activates strongly with words like "caring," "sanctity," "honestly," "fairly," and "honesty." These words are commonly associated with ethical principles or moral behaviors.

2. **Contextual Application**: The surrounding context in each example reinforces the ethical or moral nature of the activated token. For instance:
   - "Caring" appears in a context of solidarity and concern for others' well-being.
   - "Sanctity" is associated with respecting something important (nourishment).
   - "Honestly" and "fairly" are tied to fair practices and principles, whether in financial matters (taxes) or interpersonal relationships (business partnerships).
   - "Honesty" is explicitly linked with upholding a principle.

3. **Consistent"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
