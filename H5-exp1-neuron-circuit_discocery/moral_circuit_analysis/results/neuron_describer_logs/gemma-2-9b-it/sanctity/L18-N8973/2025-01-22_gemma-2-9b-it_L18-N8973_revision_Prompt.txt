=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 18, index 8973, appears to activate in contexts that emphasize actions or behaviors that convey politeness, formality, or maintaining social norms and connections. Here's the breakdown of the pattern it detects:

1. **Politeness and Formality**: The neuron shows activation in contexts where politeness or formal actions are present. This is seen in phrases like "Saluting superiors," "Speaking politely," and "Standing up for a colleague," where there's an underlying theme of respect and conformity to social or hierarchical expectations.

2. **Contextual Action**: The neuron tends to activate on tokens that contribute to or are part of an action, especially when these actions uphold interpersonal or societal conventions. Examples include "Saluting," "Speaking," and "Standing up," indicating a sensitivity to actions that are deliberate and respectful in nature.

3. **Gerunds and Present Participles**: The neuron frequently activates around gerunds or present participles (e.g., ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Bowing respectfully before entering the room, he maintained eye contact with the elders, ensuring his actions were perfectly aligned with cultural expectations."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Writing thank you notes for all the guests, she emphasized gratitude and the importance of good manners in every word."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Holding the door open for others, he smiled warmly, embodying the spirit of politeness and courtesy."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In a formal setting, shaking hands firmly and introducing oneself with a respectful tone is considered essential."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "While organizing the event, she ensured that every guest was greeted with a warm welcome and polite conversation."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
