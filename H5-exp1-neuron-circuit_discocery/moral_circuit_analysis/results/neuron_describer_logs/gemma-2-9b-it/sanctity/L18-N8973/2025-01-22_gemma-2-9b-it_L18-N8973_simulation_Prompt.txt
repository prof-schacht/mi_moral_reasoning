Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 18, index 8973, activates in contexts that emphasize formal actions, politeness, and adherence to social norms, with a particular sensitivity to actions that involve direct interpersonal interactions. The new evidence suggests the following refined patterns:

1. **Politeness and Formality**: The neuron consistently activates in scenarios where actions are performed with an emphasis on politeness and formality. This is supported by phrases like "Bowing respectfully," "Writing thank you notes," and "Holding the door open," which all reflect actions that are polite and considerate. The high activation in "In a formal setting, shaking hands firmly and introducing oneself with a respectful tone" further underscores the neuron's sensitivity to formal interpersonal interactions.

2. **Interpersonal Interaction**: The neuron shows heightened activation in contexts involving direct interpersonal actions, particularly those that are culturally or socially significant. The test case with the highest activation ("In a formal setting, shaking hands firmly and introducing oneself with a respectful tone") indicates that the neuron is especially responsive to actions that involve direct engagement with others in a formal context.

3. **Gerunds and Present Participles**: The neuron's activation around gerunds and present participles is confirmed, as seen in phrases like "Bowing," "Writing," and "Holding." These forms often describe ongoing actions that are deliberate and respectful, aligning with the neuron's pattern of detecting actions that convey politeness and formality.

4. **"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
