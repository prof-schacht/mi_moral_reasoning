=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 22, index 6202 appears to detect linguistic patterns related to respectful or ethical actions and behaviors, often involving connotations of politeness, care, and propriety within social or formal settings. Let's analyze its activations based on the provided examples:

1. **Token "to" in "Speaking politely to...":** The activation here suggests the neuron's sensitivity to contexts where "to" follows action-oriented verbs (e.g., "speaking") particularly in formal or social politeness scenarios. The context involves social courtesy or interactions.

2. **Token "to" in "Speaking kindly to those...":** Similar to the first example, the neuron activates when "to" follows a verb that implies a manner of speaking or interacting. This strengthens the pattern where "to" is linked to verbs denoting positive or considerate actions towards others.

3. **Token "avoiding" in "Body integrityâ€”such as avoiding...":** Here, the neuron appears to"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Extending a helping hand to those in need is a gesture of kindness and respect."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "She took great care to address everyone by their proper titles during the formal dinner."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "By choosing to walk gently on the path, he showed respect for the ancient grounds."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "Avoiding interruptions during the meeting was crucial to maintaining a respectful dialogue."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "Speaking directly to the heart of the issue, she managed to convey her concerns with grace."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
