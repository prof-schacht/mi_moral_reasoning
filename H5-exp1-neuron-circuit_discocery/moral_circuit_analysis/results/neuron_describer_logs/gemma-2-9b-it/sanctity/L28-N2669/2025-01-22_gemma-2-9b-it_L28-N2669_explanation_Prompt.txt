Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 28, Neuron: 2669
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 28, index 2669) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  historical figures in government fosters a sense of continuity and order

Token:  dignity	Activation: 10.0	Context: ing burial grounds honors human dignity and sanctity.

Token: s	Activation: 10.0	Context: Attending your partnerâ€™s special events as a show

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  allocate resources to ensure that the sick receive proper medical care

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
