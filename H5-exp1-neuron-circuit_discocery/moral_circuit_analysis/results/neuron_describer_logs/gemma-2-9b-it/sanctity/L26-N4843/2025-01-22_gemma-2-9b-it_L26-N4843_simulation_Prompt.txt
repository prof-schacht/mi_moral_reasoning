Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 26, index 4843, demonstrates a nuanced sensitivity to the prepositions "at" and "in," particularly in contexts that involve specific locations associated with activities or states of being. The new evidence provides additional insights into the neuron's activation patterns, leading to a refined understanding:

1. **Preposition Usage**: 
   - The neuron is indeed activated by the tokens "at" and "in," but with varying degrees of sensitivity. The preposition "at" consistently triggers higher activation levels compared to "in," especially when it introduces a specific location tied to an activity or a state of being.

2. **Contextual Associations**:
   - **High Activation with "At"**: The neuron shows strong activation when "at" is used in contexts that denote a specific location where an activity is taking place. For example, "meditating at the serene lakeside" (activation: 10.000) and "working tirelessly at the hospital" (activation: 9.000) both involve specific locations tied to significant activities or states of being.
   - **Moderate Activation with "In"**: The activation is notably lower when "in" is used, even when it introduces a location related to an activity. For instance, "in the heart of the bustling city" (activation: 2.000) and "in the park" (activation: 2.000) suggest that the"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
