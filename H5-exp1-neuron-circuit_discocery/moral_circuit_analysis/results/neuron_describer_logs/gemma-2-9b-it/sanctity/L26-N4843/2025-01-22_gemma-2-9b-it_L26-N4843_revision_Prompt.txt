=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 26, index 4843, appears to be highly responsive to the prepositions "at" and "in" when they are used to denote specific locations or contexts involving activities or states of being. Let's break down the observed patterns:

1. **Preposition Usage**: The neuron is activated by the tokens "at" and "in." These prepositions are used to specify a location or context where an action or state is taking place. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to the semantic role of these tokens in situating actions or activities within a particular location or context.

2. **Contextual Associations**:
   - The activations occur in contexts where the prepositions introduce a location or situation related to activities, duties, or events. For instance, in the example "Dressing formally at official shows respect for," the word "at" is introducing a formal setting related to professional decorum.
   - Similarly, in "Volunteering at shelters" and"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "She was meditating at the serene lakeside, finding peace in the gentle waves."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "In the heart of the bustling city, they found a quiet caf√© to unwind after work."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "At dawn, the fishermen set out to sea, ready for a long day of work."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "The children played in the park, laughing and chasing each other around the swings."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Working tirelessly at the hospital, she dedicated her nights to saving lives."
Activation: 9.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
