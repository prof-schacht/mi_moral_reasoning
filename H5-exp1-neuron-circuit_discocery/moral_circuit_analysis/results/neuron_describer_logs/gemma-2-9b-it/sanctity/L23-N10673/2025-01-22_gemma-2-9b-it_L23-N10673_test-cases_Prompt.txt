=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question seems to be responsive to a pattern involving the use of certain grammatical constructs, particularly prepositions and possessive pronouns, within the context of conveying guidance, rules, or compositional relationships.

1. **Pattern Triggering Activation**: The neuron primarily activates on prepositions and possessive pronouns (e.g., "certain," "avoiding," "for," "in," "your") that connect ideas or components in a way that implies adherence to rules, instructions, or relational contexts. These constructs typically appear in sentences where certain compositional or instructive meaning is being constructed.

2. **Contextual Patterns**: 
   - In the given examples, tokens like "certain" and "avoiding" signify restrictions or guidelines (e.g., "refraining from certain foods," "avoiding harmful piercings"), suggesting an emphasis on implicit rules or personal conduct.
   - The prepositions "for" and "in" appear in contexts that relate to supported"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
