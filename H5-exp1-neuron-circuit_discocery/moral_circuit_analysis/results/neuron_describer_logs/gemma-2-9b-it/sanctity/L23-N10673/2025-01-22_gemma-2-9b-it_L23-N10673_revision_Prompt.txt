Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question seems to be responsive to a pattern involving the use of certain grammatical constructs, particularly prepositions and possessive pronouns, within the context of conveying guidance, rules, or compositional relationships.

1. **Pattern Triggering Activation**: The neuron primarily activates on prepositions and possessive pronouns (e.g., "certain," "avoiding," "for," "in," "your") that connect ideas or components in a way that implies adherence to rules, instructions, or relational contexts. These constructs typically appear in sentences where certain compositional or instructive meaning is being constructed.

2. **Contextual Patterns**: 
   - In the given examples, tokens like "certain" and "avoiding" signify restrictions or guidelines (e.g., "refraining from certain foods," "avoiding harmful piercings"), suggesting an emphasis on implicit rules or personal conduct.
   - The prepositions "for" and "in" appear in contexts that relate to supported"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "For your safety, avoid walking in the construction area without wearing a helmet."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In planning your trip, consider the restrictions on liquids in your carry-on luggage."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Use the following guidelines for your project submission: ensure all files are in PDF format."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Your success in this course depends on adhering to deadlines and participating actively in discussions."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "To enhance your learning experience, engage in activities that encourage critical thinking and creativity."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
