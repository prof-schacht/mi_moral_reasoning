Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question is responsive to patterns involving the use of prepositions and possessive pronouns, particularly within contexts that convey guidance, rules, or compositional relationships. However, new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns.

1. **Pattern Triggering Activation**: The neuron activates strongly in contexts where prepositions and possessive pronouns are used to frame instructions, guidelines, or rules. The presence of these constructs in sentences that emphasize adherence to safety, planning, or success criteria appears to be a significant trigger. For example, high activation is observed in sentences like "For your safety, avoid walking in the construction area without wearing a helmet" and "Your success in this course depends on adhering to deadlines and participating actively in discussions," where the language clearly outlines rules or guidelines.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The original explanation's emphasis on prepositions and possessive pronouns is supported, but the new evidence highlights that the neuron's activation is particularly strong when these constructs are part of sentences that explicitly convey safety instructions, planning considerations, or success criteria.
   - The activation levels suggest that the neuron is more responsive to contexts that involve direct engagement or action-oriented guidance, as seen in "To enhance your learning experience, engage in activities that encourage critical thinking and creativity," which received the highest activation score.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron appears less responsive to contexts that are purely"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
