Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The original explanation correctly identifies that the neuron activates in contexts emphasizing **authenticity** and **adherence to principles**. This is supported by the activation in phrases like "truly aligned with the values of justice and equality" and "genuinely ethical," where the focus is on genuine alignment with core values or ethics.

2. **Aspects to Modify or Remove**:
   - The original explanation's emphasis on **responsibility** as a trigger is less supported by the new evidence. While responsibility might be a component of the broader themes, the test cases do not strongly indicate it as a primary trigger for activation.
   - The concept of **unity** or **collective experience** as a trigger is not consistently supported. While "shared vision" and "shared equally" appear in the test cases, they do not result in high activation levels, suggesting these are not primary triggers.

3. **New Patterns or Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows high activation with phrases that combine **authenticity** with **alignment to values or principles**, as seen in "truly aligned with the values of justice and equality."
   - The presence of the word "truly" in contexts that emphasize genuine adherence to principles or values consistently results in higher activation, indicating a strong association with authenticity.
   - The neuron seems to respond more to the **contextual reinforcement of principles** rather than"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
