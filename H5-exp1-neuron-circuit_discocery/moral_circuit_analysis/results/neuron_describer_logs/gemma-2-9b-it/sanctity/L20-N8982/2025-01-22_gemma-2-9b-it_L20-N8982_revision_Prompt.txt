Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "To understand the behavior of neuron (layer 20, index 8982), let's analyze the examples provided and identify the pattern that leads to its activation.

1. **Token Analysis**:
   - **not**: In the context, this token highlights a commitment to avoiding negative impact, emphasizing responsibility.
   - **truly**: This token reinforces an adjective within the context, suggesting authenticity or the genuine nature of a free society.
   - **shared**: Here, the token emphasizes unity and collective human experience.
   - **true**: This token is used to denote genuineness or authenticity, particularly in relation to justice.
   - **fairness**: Associated with principles or values, emphasizing equality or justness.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens that emphasize **authenticity, responsibility, or adherence to principles.** These concepts are often highlighted by keywords that enforce the genuineness or foundational value of the ideas they modify."

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee's decision was not only fair but truly aligned with the values of justice and equality."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "In a truly democratic society, every individual's voice is heard and their rights are shared equally among all."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The organization made a commitment to not only improve transparency but to also ensure that all practices are genuinely ethical."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The concept of fairness is not just an ideal but a fundamental principle that guides our policies and decisions."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "He has a truly remarkable ability to unite people and create a shared vision that everyone can believe in."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
