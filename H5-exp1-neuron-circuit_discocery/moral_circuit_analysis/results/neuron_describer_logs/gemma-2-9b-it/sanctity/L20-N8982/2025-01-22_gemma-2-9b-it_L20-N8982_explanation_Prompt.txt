Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 20, Neuron: 8982
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 20, index 8982) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  not	Activation: 10.0	Context:  reduction reflect a commitment to not degrading the environment.

Token:  truly	Activation: 10.0	Context:  on controversial topics fosters a truly free society.

Token:  shared	Activation: 10.0	Context:  feels lonely upholds our shared humanity.

Token:  true	Activation: 10.0	Context:  objectively is the basis of true justice.

Token:  fairness	Activation: 10.0	Context:  merit and financial need respects fairness.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
