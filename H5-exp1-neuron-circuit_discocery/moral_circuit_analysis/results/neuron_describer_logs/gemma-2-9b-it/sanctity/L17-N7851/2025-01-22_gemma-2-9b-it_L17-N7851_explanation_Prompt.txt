Layer: 17, Neuron: 7851
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 7851) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  through	Activation: 10.0	Context: Supporting your childhood sports team through losing seasons demonstrates steadfastness

Token:  like	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Religious authority, like like or imams,

Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
