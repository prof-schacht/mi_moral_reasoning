Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron (layer 12, index 3116) appears to activate in response to tokens associated with nuanced or specific responsibilities, characteristics, or qualities within a particular context. Here's a detailed analysis of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern Trigger:** The neuron activates for tokens that are nouns or noun-like, representing either an attribute or a key aspect of a broader concept, particularly where there is an implied sense of responsibility, obligation, or intrinsic quality. This includes:
   - **"accountable"**: This relates to responsibility and the expectation of adhering to promises or commitments.
   - **"candidate"**: This indicates consideration or evaluation for a particular role or purpose, emphasizing an intrinsic quality or characteristic.
   - **"drinking"** (in "drinking water"): In both cases, the word is coupled with cleanliness, safety, and health obligations or priorities, indicating the essential nature of water in these contexts.
   - **"expression"**"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
