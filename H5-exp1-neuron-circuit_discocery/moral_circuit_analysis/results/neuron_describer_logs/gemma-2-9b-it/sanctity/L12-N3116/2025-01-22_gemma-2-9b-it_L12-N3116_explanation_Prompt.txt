Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 12, index 3116) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context:  held accountable for breaking promises or contracts.

Token:  candidate	Activation: 10.0	Context:  accurately and fairly for each candidate.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
