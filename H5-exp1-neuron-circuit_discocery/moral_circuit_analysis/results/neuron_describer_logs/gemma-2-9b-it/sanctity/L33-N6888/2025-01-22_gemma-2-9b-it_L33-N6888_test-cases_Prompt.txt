=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 33, index 6888) appears to be responsive to tokens that serve a descriptive or relational function, particularly those involving social or relational contexts. Here's a breakdown of its activation pattern:

1. **Descriptive/Relational Contexts**:
   - The neuron activates strongly for tokens that either describe relationships between people or highlight a relational aspect of identity or role. For instance, "estranged," "grieving," and "elderly" are terms that describe specific states of people or their relational position. This suggests sensitivity to words that denote personal or social conditions or roles.

2. **Social/Emotional Context**:
   - The activated tokens often appear in contexts that emphasize social relationships and emotional states or actions. Words like "estranged," "grieving," and "elderly" indicate a focus on interpersonal dynamics or conditions requiring social attention or empathy. 
   - The context of these tokens typically involves actions or traits that suggest social duty or emotional"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
