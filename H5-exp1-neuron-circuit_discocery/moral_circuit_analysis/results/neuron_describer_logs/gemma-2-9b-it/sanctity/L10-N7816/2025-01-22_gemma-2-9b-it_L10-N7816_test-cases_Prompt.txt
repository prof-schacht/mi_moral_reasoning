=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron at layer 10, index 7816 appears to respond to linguistic patterns involving repetition or emphasis within a sentence structure. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Repetition or Doubling**: The activations for the tokens "and" and "excessive" both occur in contexts where the word itself or a closely related concept is repeated ("and and" and "excessive... excessive"). This suggests that this neuron is tuned to detect repetitive constructions or words being emphasized through repetition.

2. **Uncommon or Marked Usage**: The activations often appear in scenarios where the usage is either uncommon or notably marked. For instance, "to to" as a phrase, while grammatically possible, is unconventional, which might indicate that the neuron is sensitive to anomalies or emphatic elements that stand out due to their structure or redundancy.

3. **Contextual Enhancement**: The surrounding context often includes formal or elevated language, such"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
