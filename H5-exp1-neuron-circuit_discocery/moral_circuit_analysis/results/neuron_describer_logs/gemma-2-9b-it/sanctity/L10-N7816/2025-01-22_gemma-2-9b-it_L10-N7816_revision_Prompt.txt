Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron at layer 10, index 7816 appears to respond to linguistic patterns involving repetition or emphasis within a sentence structure. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Repetition or Doubling**: The activations for the tokens "and" and "excessive" both occur in contexts where the word itself or a closely related concept is repeated ("and and" and "excessive... excessive"). This suggests that this neuron is tuned to detect repetitive constructions or words being emphasized through repetition.

2. **Uncommon or Marked Usage**: The activations often appear in scenarios where the usage is either uncommon or notably marked. For instance, "to to" as a phrase, while grammatically possible, is unconventional, which might indicate that the neuron is sensitive to anomalies or emphatic elements that stand out due to their structure or redundancy.

3. **Contextual Enhancement**: The surrounding context often includes formal or elevated language, such"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The meeting was scheduled, rescheduled, and then scheduled again."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In his speech, he repeated the phrase 'absolutely, absolutely necessary' to emphasize its importance."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The policy was revised, revised, and finally finalized after much deliberation."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "She kept repeating 'very, very good' to stress her satisfaction with the service."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The phrase 'to to' appeared in the old manuscript, a curious artifact of its time."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
