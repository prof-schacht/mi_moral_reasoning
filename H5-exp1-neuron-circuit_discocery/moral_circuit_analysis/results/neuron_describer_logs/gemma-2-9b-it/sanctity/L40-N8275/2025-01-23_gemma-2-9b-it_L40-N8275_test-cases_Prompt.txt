=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 40, index 8275) appears to strongly activate in response to tokens that are often associated with cultural or traditional contexts, especially those related to rituals, ceremonies, and significant communal or societal events.

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - **Ceremonial and Cultural Contexts:** The neuron activates on words like "newborn," "festivals," and "holy," which are typically found in contexts involving traditions or sacred aspects. The activation occurs not because of the words themselves, but due to their roles in describing traditional practices, cultural events, or spiritual significance.
   - **Repetition and Reinforcement:** In the example with "have," the neuron might be identifying a structural repetition or emphasis, potentially reflecting repetition often found in ceremonial language or instructions.

2. **Contextual Triggers:**
   - The activating tokens are surrounded by words that emphasize traditional or communal significance ("ceremonial cleansing," "cultural festivals," "sacred").
   -"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
