Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 26, Neuron: 3754
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 26, index 3754) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  on the road shows respect for life.

Token:  unacceptable	Activation: 10.0	Context:  ethnic discrimination in hiring is unacceptable because it denies equal opportunity

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  confessions secret out of respect for your friendâ€™s privacy

Token: ;	Activation: 10.0	Context:  mental health issues is important; we should encourage one another

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
