=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron, located in layer 26 at index 3754, responds to a specific linguistic pattern related to the use of language that signifies respect, duty, or the upholding of values or principles. Let's break down the consistent activation patterns:

1. **Prepositional Anchors with Value-Oriented Contexts**:
   - Tokens such as "for" and "of" are prepositions, and the neuron activates when these tokens are part of constructions that denote respect for principles or entities, such as "respect for life," "sanctity of nourishment," or maintaining "confessions secret out of respect."
   - The context surrounding these prepositions frequently involves an action or stance associated with honoring, valuing, or respecting someone or something (e.g., life, privacy, nourishment).

2. **Judgment or Value-Laden Adjectives**:
   - The token "unacceptable" indicates a strong judgment about behavior or actions (e.g., "discrimination in hiring"),"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The campaign emphasized the importance of respect for human dignity, highlighting how crucial it is to uphold these core values."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Out of a sense of duty, the committee maintained confidentiality about the sensitive matter, respecting the privacy of all involved."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Honoring the traditions of our ancestors is essential for preserving cultural heritage and showing respect for their wisdom."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "She deemed the treatment of animals in these facilities as utterly unacceptable, voicing her concern strongly."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The athlete's commitment to fair play and sportsmanship showed a profound respect for the spirit of the game."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
