=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, located in layer 26 at index 3754, responds to a specific linguistic pattern related to the use of language that signifies respect, duty, or the upholding of values or principles. Let's break down the consistent activation patterns:

1. **Prepositional Anchors with Value-Oriented Contexts**:
   - Tokens such as "for" and "of" are prepositions, and the neuron activates when these tokens are part of constructions that denote respect for principles or entities, such as "respect for life," "sanctity of nourishment," or maintaining "confessions secret out of respect."
   - The context surrounding these prepositions frequently involves an action or stance associated with honoring, valuing, or respecting someone or something (e.g., life, privacy, nourishment).

2. **Judgment or Value-Laden Adjectives**:
   - The token "unacceptable" indicates a strong judgment about behavior or actions (e.g., "discrimination in hiring"),"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
