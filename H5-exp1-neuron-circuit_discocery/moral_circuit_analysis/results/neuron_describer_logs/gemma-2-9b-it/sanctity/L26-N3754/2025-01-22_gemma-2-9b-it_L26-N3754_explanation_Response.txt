=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron, located in layer 26 at index 3754, responds to a specific linguistic pattern related to the use of language that signifies respect, duty, or the upholding of values or principles. Let's break down the consistent activation patterns:

1. **Prepositional Anchors with Value-Oriented Contexts**:
   - Tokens such as "for" and "of" are prepositions, and the neuron activates when these tokens are part of constructions that denote respect for principles or entities, such as "respect for life," "sanctity of nourishment," or maintaining "confessions secret out of respect."
   - The context surrounding these prepositions frequently involves an action or stance associated with honoring, valuing, or respecting someone or something (e.g., life, privacy, nourishment).

2. **Judgment or Value-Laden Adjectives**:
   - The token "unacceptable" indicates a strong judgment about behavior or actions (e.g., "discrimination in hiring"),
