Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 15, index 9492) demonstrates a nuanced responsiveness to contexts that emphasize support, commitment, and the preservation of tradition and values. However, the new evidence suggests a more specific pattern of activation than initially described. Here is a refined breakdown:

1. **Token Analysis**:
    - **supported**: This token continues to show a strong activation (10.000) when associated with contexts that emphasize alignment with traditional values and ethical standards. This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to themes of backing and commitment, particularly when linked to tradition.
    - **steadfast**: The neuron shows moderate activation (3.000) in contexts where steadfastness is linked to ethical decisions or maintaining the status quo. This suggests that the neuron's response is more pronounced when steadfastness is directly tied to traditional values rather than just any firm adherence.
    - **uph** (from "upholds"): The activation is lower (2.000) in contexts of upholding principles during a presidency, indicating that while the neuron recognizes the maintenance of standards, it is less responsive unless these are explicitly tied to tradition or cultural heritage.
    - **presidency**: The lower activation (2.000) suggests that the neuron's response is not strongly triggered by the concept of structured roles unless they are explicitly linked to traditional values or cultural preservation.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - **Commitment and Support**: The"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
