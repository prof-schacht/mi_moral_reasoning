=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 15, index 9492) seems to be highly responsive to tokens that appear within contexts emphasizing support, commitment, or maintenance of tradition and values. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Token Analysis**:
    - **supported**: This token clearly relates to providing aid or backing, typically seen in established relationships or commitments (e.g., political support).
    - **ining** (from "refraining"): This token part appears in contexts suggesting restraint or abstention, often in maintaining a certain ethical or moral stance.
    - **steadfast**: Suggests unwavering and firm adherence to principles or loyalty, emphasizing consistency and determination.
    - **uph** (from "upholds"): Indicates maintaining or preserving certain standards, often moral or ethical.
    - **presidency**: Although broader, it implies a structured, traditional role that is often maintained over time.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - **Commitment and Support**"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The senator steadfastly supported the new legislation, emphasizing its alignment with traditional values and ethical standards."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "In his presidency, he was known for upholding the principles of integrity and commitment to public service."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Despite the pressure, she remained steadfast in her decision to refrain from actions that would compromise her ethical stance."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The community's unwavering support for the preservation of their cultural heritage was evident in their annual festival."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "While controversial, his actions were perceived as a steadfast commitment to maintaining the status quo."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
