Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 22, index 3581) is primarily activated by themes related to upholding ethical standards, integrity, and protective behavior, particularly in contexts where there is a clear emphasis on preventing harm or advocating for justice. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, revealing specific patterns that trigger the neuron.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - **Ethical Standards and Integrity**: The neuron is consistently activated by contexts that involve maintaining ethical standards and integrity, as seen in examples discussing product defects and the disclosure of harmful chemicals. These scenarios emphasize the importance of ethical business practices and public safety.
   - **Protection and Advocacy**: The neuron is highly activated by contexts involving protection and advocacy, such as in the case of cyberbullying. This suggests a strong response to themes of defending individuals and upholding justice.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - **Respect and Social Decorum**: While the neuron is activated by themes of respect, as seen in the context of addressing teachers, the activation level is moderate compared to scenarios involving direct harm prevention or ethical violations. This indicates that while respect is relevant, it is not as strong a trigger as themes directly related to harm prevention or ethical breaches.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - **Harm Prevention and Safety**: The neuron shows significant activation in contexts where there is a direct emphasis on preventing harm, such as in"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
