Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 22, index 3581) appears to detect the notion of maintaining standards or values, particularly relating to ethical, respectful, or protective behavior. Let's break down the examples to understand the triggering pattern:

1. **Tokens and Themes**: 
   - The tokens "product," "respectful," "bullying," "harmful," and "reckless" are associated with situations where integrity, respect, or safety is emphasized. These words often pertain to conditions where there is an expectation or need to uphold certain standards or avoid negative consequences.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - **Product**: The context discusses disclosing defects, suggesting ethical business practices.
   - **Respectful**: The context involves addressing teachers in a manner that supports authority and order, indicating social decorum.
   - **Bullying**: The context points to the protection of individuals, emphasizing advocacy and defense against harm.
   - **Harmful**:"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "In the workplace, it is crucial to report any product defects immediately to avoid potential harm to consumers and maintain the company's integrity."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Teachers should be addressed with respect to foster a positive learning environment and uphold educational standards."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Cyberbullying can have severe psychological impacts, and advocating for victims is essential to uphold justice and protect individuals."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "The reckless handling of sensitive data could lead to harmful breaches, emphasizing the need for stringent cybersecurity measures."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "A company's failure to disclose harmful chemicals in their products is a violation of ethical standards, potentially endangering public safety."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
