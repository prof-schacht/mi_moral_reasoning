Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 21, index 9007) appears to activate based on a pattern related to organizational structure and formal institutional contexts, particularly focusing on concepts or terminology associated with structured or regulated environments. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of what specifically triggers the neuron.

1. **Patterned Triggers**:
   - The neuron is activated by terms and contexts that emphasize the structural and hierarchical aspects of organizations or institutions. It responds to words and phrases that denote formal constructs, systematic functions, or principles within these environments.
   - Words like "independence," "metrics," and "hierarchy" consistently trigger the neuron when they are part of a context that highlights structural autonomy, evaluation processes, or defined roles within an organization.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where there is an explicit evaluation or alignment process within a structured setting, as seen in "quarterly review" and "performance metrics" aligning with "strategic goals."
   - The concept of "independence" triggers the neuron when it is tied to fundamental principles or autonomy within a larger system, such as the judiciary or central bank.
   - The neuron does not activate in contexts that merely describe procedural frameworks or compliance without a direct emphasis on structural evaluation or autonomy, as seen in the zero activation for "new policy mandates regular audits."

3. **Refined Understanding**:
   - The neuron is less responsive to"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
