Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 21, index 9007) appears to activate based on a pattern related to organizational structure and formal institutional contexts, especially involving concepts or terminology that are associated with structured or regulated environments. The examples show a consistent activation in contexts that suggest elements of hierarchy, roles, or procedural frameworks.

1. **Patterned Triggers**:
   - The neuron seems to trigger on words that denote or are associated with formal constructs or systematic functions within an organizational or structured context. For instance, words like "independence," "metrics," "the," "new," and "a" in their contexts relate to ideas or actions structured within a system.
   
2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - In the context of "in meetings as part of the hierarchy," the word "the" contributes to describing a specific institutional process or structure.
   - "Independence" in financial and state contexts indicates structural autonomy within larger systems.
   - "New," in the context"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "During the quarterly review, the committee evaluated the new performance metrics to ensure alignment with the strategic goals."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In the legal framework, independence of the judiciary is a fundamental principle that upholds the separation of powers."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The company's organizational chart clearly outlines the hierarchy and roles each member plays within the corporate structure."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "As part of the procedural framework, the new policy mandates regular audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The independence of the central bank is crucial to maintaining economic stability and preventing government interference in monetary policy."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
