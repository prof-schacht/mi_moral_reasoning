=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 21, index 9007) appears to activate based on a pattern related to organizational structure and formal institutional contexts, especially involving concepts or terminology that are associated with structured or regulated environments. The examples show a consistent activation in contexts that suggest elements of hierarchy, roles, or procedural frameworks.

1. **Patterned Triggers**:
   - The neuron seems to trigger on words that denote or are associated with formal constructs or systematic functions within an organizational or structured context. For instance, words like "independence," "metrics," "the," "new," and "a" in their contexts relate to ideas or actions structured within a system.
   
2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - In the context of "in meetings as part of the hierarchy," the word "the" contributes to describing a specific institutional process or structure.
   - "Independence" in financial and state contexts indicates structural autonomy within larger systems.
   - "New," in the context"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
