=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 12, index 12834, appears to activate in response to patterns characteristic of syntactic constructs indicative of grammatical errors or stylistic inconsistencies, specifically focusing on redundancy and erroneous repetition.

1. **Redundancy and Repetition Detection**: The neuron activates strongly on tokens associated with accidental repetition or redundancy in the context. In the examples provided, it primarily responds to:
   - The repetitive use of the word "able" in "Individuals should be able able choose their own diet" and "the" in "Individuals should have the the to make personal choices." These examples suggest that the neuron is tuned to detect repeated words.
   - This pattern of activation indicates that the neuron is sensitive to identifying potential errors in writing that involve unintended word duplication.

2. **Association with Sentence Boundaries or Emphasis**: The neuron also shows activation at the end of statements (as seen with "HR to maintain organizational order." and "objectively, without favoritism.") and"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
