=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 14, index 11079) seems to respond to contexts where a sense of inclusivity, collective action, or involvement is implied. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Inclusivity and Collaboration**: 
   - Tokens like "extensive" in the context "Traveling abroad without extensive extensive hurdles is a right" and "walking" in "within the family rather than walking away shows commitment" suggest an environment or scenario in which involvement, participation, or collaboration is highlighted. The choice of words often pertains to comprehensive actions or inclusive processes.
   
2. **Conditional and Possessive Constructs**:
    - The token "have" in "public condemnation, unless they have done real harm, is" appears in a conditional sentence, indicating an inclusive condition under which a state or collective understanding exists. Similarly, the use of the possessive "’" in "a group project ensures everyone’s effort is recognized" highlights group involvement and collective recognition of efforts"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The community garden thrives only when everyone contributes their time and resources."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "A successful team is one where each member’s unique talents are utilized and celebrated."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Without ensuring all voices are heard during the meeting, the decision-making process remains incomplete."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The festival was a success because each volunteer took on responsibilities that matched their strengths."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "For the project to succeed, it’s crucial that every stakeholder’s input is considered."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
