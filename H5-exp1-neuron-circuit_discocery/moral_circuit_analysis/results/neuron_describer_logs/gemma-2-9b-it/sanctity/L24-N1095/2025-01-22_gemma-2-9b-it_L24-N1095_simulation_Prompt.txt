Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 24, index 1095) is primarily responsive to tokens within phrases that convey ethical, moral, or social evaluations, particularly those involving fairness, justice, and integrity. The neuron is activated by language that implies a moral or ethical judgment, often highlighting principles or values that are socially significant.

**Supported Aspects:**
1. **Moral and Ethical Contexts:** The original explanation's focus on moral and ethical contexts is supported. The neuron activates strongly in contexts where moral evaluations or ethical principles are discussed, as seen in examples like "unjust," "unethical," and "moral standards."

**Modified Aspects:**
1. **Specificity of Activation:** The new evidence suggests that the neuron is more specifically triggered by tokens that directly relate to moral or ethical evaluations rather than general social conduct. For instance, "unethical," "injustice," and "moral standards" all involve explicit ethical judgments.

2. **Intensity of Activation:** The activation levels vary based on the strength of the moral or ethical implication. For example, "Honesty is a fundamental value" has the highest activation, indicating a strong association with core ethical principles.

**New Patterns and Nuances:**
1. **Focus on Core Values:** The neuron shows heightened activation for tokens that are part of phrases emphasizing core values like honesty and fairness. This suggests a sensitivity to language that underscores fundamental ethical principles.

2. **Social Justice and Fairness"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
