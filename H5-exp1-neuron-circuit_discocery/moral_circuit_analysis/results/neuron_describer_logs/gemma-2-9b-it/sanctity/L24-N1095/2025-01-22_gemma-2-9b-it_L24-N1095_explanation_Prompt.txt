Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 1095
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 1095) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  unjust	Activation: 10.0	Context:  peacefully protest laws they find unjust.

Token: olds	Activation: 10.0	Context:  teachers with respectful language upholds classroom authority.

Token:  honors	Activation: 10.0	Context:  reverently of military veterans honors their service to the country

Token:  hard	Activation: 10.0	Context:  emotional support and reassurance during hard times.

Token:  market	Activation: 10.0	Context:  defects to maintain an honest market.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
