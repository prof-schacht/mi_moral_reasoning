Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron (layer 26, index 12469) is responsive to concepts related to actions, responsibilities, and roles that imply a sense of obligation or proactive engagement, particularly within structured or formal contexts. The new evidence provides further insight into the neuron's behavior, highlighting specific patterns that trigger its activation. Here's a refined breakdown:

1. **Pronouns Indicating Responsibility or Possession:**
   - **Tokens: "their," "your"**
     - The neuron's activation is consistent with the original explanation, showing sensitivity to possessive pronouns that denote responsibility or ownership. These pronouns are often linked to roles or duties in professional or procedural settings. The test cases confirm that contexts involving explicit responsibilities (e.g., ensuring project deadlines, providing support) trigger strong activation.

2. **Purposeful Action and Outcome:**
   - **Token: "to"**
     - The neuron's response to "to" as a conjunction leading to purposeful actions or outcomes is supported by the evidence. However, the activation levels suggest that the neuron's sensitivity is heightened when the context emphasizes collective or individual commitment to achieving specific goals (e.g., following protocols, taking ownership of tasks). The activation is notably higher when the context involves a clear, collective action or responsibility.

3. **Collective Engagement and Ownership:**
   - The new evidence reveals a stronger activation when the context involves collective engagement or ownership of tasks. For instance, phrases that emphasize everyone"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
