Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 11, index 8864, appears to respond to tokens that signal the absence or prevention of negative conditions or actions, often within contexts emphasizing fairness, transparency, or safety. Let's break down the activation examples to reveal the neuronâ€™s pattern:
