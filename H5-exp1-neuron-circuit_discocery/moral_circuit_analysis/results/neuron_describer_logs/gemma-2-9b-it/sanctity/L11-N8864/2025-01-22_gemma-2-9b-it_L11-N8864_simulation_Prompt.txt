Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 11, index 8864, primarily responds to contexts involving the prevention of negative outcomes, particularly in scenarios emphasizing safety, transparency, and proactive measures. The new evidence suggests a refined understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Prevention and Safety:**
   - The neuron strongly activates in contexts where actions are taken to prevent negative outcomes, especially those related to safety and security. For example, the phrase "prevent accidents and ensure a secure workplace environment" (activation: 8.000) aligns with this pattern, highlighting the neuron's sensitivity to safety protocols and proactive prevention measures.

2. **Transparency and Fairness:**
   - While the neuron does respond to themes of transparency and fairness, the activation is moderate compared to safety-related contexts. In the example "ensure transparency in financial reporting, preventing any deceptive practices" (activation: 5.000), the neuron recognizes the prevention of deception as a key factor, but the activation is not as high as in safety contexts.

3. **Reduction of Negative Impact:**
   - The neuron's response to "reduce our carbon footprint and prevent further environmental degradation" (activation: 5.000) indicates a moderate activation when the focus is on reducing negative impacts, suggesting that the neuron is attuned to proactive environmental measures but not as strongly as to direct safety concerns.

4. **Emphasis on Non-violence and Justification:**

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
