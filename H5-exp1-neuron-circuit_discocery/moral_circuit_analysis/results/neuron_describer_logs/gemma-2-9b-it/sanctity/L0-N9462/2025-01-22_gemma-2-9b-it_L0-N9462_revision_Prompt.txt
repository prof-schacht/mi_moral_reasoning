=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 0, index 9462 appears to exhibit high activation in contexts that reflect ethical or moral assertions, rules, or principles. The examples show activation with the <bos> (beginning of sentence) token when followed by language suggesting norms, duties, or values. Here's the breakdown of how this pattern triggers the neuron:

1. **Sentence Beginnings with Moral/Aspirational Tone**: 
   - The activation consistently occurs at the beginning of sentences, as indicated by the token <bos>.
   - Each example following the activation involves statements that imply a moral or ethical responsibility (e.g., “One should always come,” “Providing shelter and food,” “We should speak out”).

2. **Presence of Imperative or Normative Language**:
   - The context post-<bos> often includes language that suggests an obligation or recommendation (“should,” “providing,” “deserves”).
   - This language conveys a sense of duty or moral guidance.

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "One must always act with integrity, even when it is difficult."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "We are obligated to help those in need whenever possible."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "Providing care and empathy is essential in building strong communities."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "You should consider the impact of your actions on others."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "It is crucial to uphold honesty in all our dealings to build trust."
Activation: 10.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
