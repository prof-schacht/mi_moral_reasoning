Prompt Type: test-cases

=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 0, index 9462 appears to exhibit high activation in contexts that reflect ethical or moral assertions, rules, or principles. The examples show activation with the <bos> (beginning of sentence) token when followed by language suggesting norms, duties, or values. Here's the breakdown of how this pattern triggers the neuron:

1. **Sentence Beginnings with Moral/Aspirational Tone**: 
   - The activation consistently occurs at the beginning of sentences, as indicated by the token <bos>.
   - Each example following the activation involves statements that imply a moral or ethical responsibility (e.g., “One should always come,” “Providing shelter and food,” “We should speak out”).

2. **Presence of Imperative or Normative Language**:
   - The context post-<bos> often includes language that suggests an obligation or recommendation (“should,” “providing,” “deserves”).
   - This language conveys a sense of duty or moral guidance.

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
