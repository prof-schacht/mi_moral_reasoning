Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 25, index 9872) displays a pattern of activation that primarily relates to concepts or actions associated with societal values and principles. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern Focus**:
   - The neuron activates for tokens that often precede or follow nouns (like "of", "consumer", "a", "moral") in contexts related to societal norms or values. These contexts usually involve a concept of continuity, integrity, community, care, or ethics.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - **Prepositional Contexts**: The token "of" activates strongly in constructs where it connects a concept to a broader thematic idea of governance, purity, or societal order. This suggests the neuron's sensitivity to structural relationships in language that bind abstract nouns to broader ethical or societal constructs.
   - **Societal Concepts**: Words like "consumer" trigger activation when they are part of a phrase emphasizing rights or equity"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The integrity of our community relies heavily on the principles of mutual respect and care."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Consumer rights have been a cornerstone of our societal values, emphasizing fairness and equity in all transactions."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In the realm of governance, the purity of intent is essential to maintaining societal order and trust."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "A moral compass is vital for ensuring that our actions align with the ethics of the society we inhabit."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The concept of continuity in leadership is often linked to the stability and ethical growth of the community."
Activation: 8.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
