Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 25, Neuron: 9872
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 9872) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in government fosters a sense of continuity and order.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  public spaces maintains a sense of communal purity.

Token:  consumer	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for all customers equally respects consumer rights.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: Recycling and waste reduction reflect a commitment to not degrading the

Token:  moral	Activation: 10.0	Context:  and giving them care demonstrates moral empathy.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
