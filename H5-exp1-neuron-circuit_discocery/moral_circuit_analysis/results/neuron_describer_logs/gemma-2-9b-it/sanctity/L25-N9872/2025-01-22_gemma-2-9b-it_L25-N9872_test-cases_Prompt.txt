=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 25, index 9872) displays a pattern of activation that primarily relates to concepts or actions associated with societal values and principles. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern Focus**:
   - The neuron activates for tokens that often precede or follow nouns (like "of", "consumer", "a", "moral") in contexts related to societal norms or values. These contexts usually involve a concept of continuity, integrity, community, care, or ethics.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - **Prepositional Contexts**: The token "of" activates strongly in constructs where it connects a concept to a broader thematic idea of governance, purity, or societal order. This suggests the neuron's sensitivity to structural relationships in language that bind abstract nouns to broader ethical or societal constructs.
   - **Societal Concepts**: Words like "consumer" trigger activation when they are part of a phrase emphasizing rights or equity"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
