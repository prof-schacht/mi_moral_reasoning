Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 3688
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 3688) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  protocols	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Following the protocols established protocols your organization prevents

Token:  crises	Activation: 10.0	Context:  they are trained to handle crises.

Token:  authorities	Activation: 10.0	Context:  curfews set by authorities helps maintain public safety.

Token:  disasters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of qualified officials during natural disasters saves lives.

Token:  avoiding	Activation: 10.0	Context: Body integrityâ€”such as avoiding harmful piercings or toxic substances

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
