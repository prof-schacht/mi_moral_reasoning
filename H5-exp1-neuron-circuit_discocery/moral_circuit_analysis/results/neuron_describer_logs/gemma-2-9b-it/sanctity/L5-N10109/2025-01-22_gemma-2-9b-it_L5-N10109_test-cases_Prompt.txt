=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 5, index 10109) appears to activate strongly in response to the `<bos>` token, which stands for "beginning of sentence." The analysis of the given examples suggests that this neuron is particularly attuned to identifying specific action-oriented contexts or initiatives right at the start of sentences. Below is a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Action-Oriented Beginnings**: The neuron consistently activates at the beginning of sentences where the context suggests an active involvement or action.

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
