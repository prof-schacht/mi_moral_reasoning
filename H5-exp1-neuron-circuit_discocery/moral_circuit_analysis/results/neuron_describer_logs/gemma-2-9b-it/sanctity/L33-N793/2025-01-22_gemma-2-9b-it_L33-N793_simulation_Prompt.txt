Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 33, index 793) activates in contexts where the text conveys themes of respect, consent, inclusivity, and collective responsibility, particularly focusing on norms and behaviors within a community or collective setting. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Consent and Privacy:** The neuron shows strong activation in contexts emphasizing the importance of consent and privacy within community interactions. For example, the text "we emphasize the importance of asking for consent before taking photos during events" resulted in high activation, highlighting the neuron's sensitivity to themes of personal boundaries and respect for individual privacy.

2. **Collective Action and Environmental Responsibility:** The neuron also strongly activates in scenarios involving collective efforts to promote environmental responsibility, as seen in the text about reducing carbon footprints by limiting single-use plastics. This suggests that the neuron is responsive to themes of collective action aimed at achieving a common good, particularly in environmental contexts.

3. **Cultural Respect and Awareness:** The neuron activates moderately in contexts involving cultural respect and awareness, such as greeting elders with a bow during a festival. This indicates that while cultural respect is a relevant theme, it may not trigger the neuron as strongly as themes directly related to consent and collective action.

4. **Regulation of Personal and Social Behaviors:** The neuron shows moderate activation in contexts involving adherence to social norms and regulations, such as maintaining noise levels at night or adhering to a dress code that"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
