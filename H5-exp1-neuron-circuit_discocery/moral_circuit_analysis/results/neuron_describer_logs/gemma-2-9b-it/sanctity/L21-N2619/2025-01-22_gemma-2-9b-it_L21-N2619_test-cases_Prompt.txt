=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 21, index 2619) appears to activate in response to tokens that serve as linguistic connectors or prepositions, which set up relationships between ideas or concepts in a sentence. Here's a breakdown of the observed pattern:

1. **Connective Functionality**: The activated tokens ("allows," "day," "and," "like," "from") all serve a function that connects ideas or provides a transition between concepts. These words either establish relationships of cause and effect, comparison, sequence, or inclusion.

2. **Contextual Transitions or Relationships**:
   - **"allows" (Activation: 10.0)**: This token connects the concept of "financial independence" with the result or effect, "more freedom." It introduces a relationship of causation or enablement.
   - **"day" (Activation: 10.0)**: Although seemingly a noun, "day" acts as a transition or set-up for the state of action or reflection"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
