Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 2619
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 2619) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  allows	Activation: 10.0	Context: Financial independence from state control allows individuals more freedom.

Token:  day	Activation: 10.0	Context: Dedicating a sacred day for rest and reflection fosters

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context:  burial grounds honors human dignity and sanctity.

Token:  like	Activation: 10.0	Context: â€™s important milestones, like graduations or weddings,

Token:  from	Activation: 10.0	Context:  farm animals to protect them from slaughter is morally praiseworthy

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
