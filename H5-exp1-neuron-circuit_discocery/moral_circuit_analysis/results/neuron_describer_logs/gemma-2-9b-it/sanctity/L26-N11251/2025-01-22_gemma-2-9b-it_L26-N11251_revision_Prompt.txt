=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 26, index 11251 appears to respond to linguistic contexts that involve discussions around principles and commitments related to social, ethical, or political themes, particularly highlighting actions or states that support or oppose these principles.

### Observed Activations:

1. **Token: '’ and Context: "by a political party you’ve long supported, despite"**
   - **Pattern:** The neuron activates in the context of a political party, indicating it's sensitive to discussions about allegiance or contradiction of support.
   
2. **Token: 'or' and Context: "must be free to join or leave any political party without"**
   - **Pattern:** The tokenizer ‘or’ is within the context of freedom of association, particularly involving political affiliations, indicating the neuron's sensitivity to discussions about personal autonomy in political contexts.
   
3. **Token: 'undermine' and Context: "Students who cheat on exams undermine equal opportunity and should face"**
   - **Pattern:** The"

    New evidence from test cases:

Activation: 4.000
Text: "Their unwavering support for human rights, even when politically risky, demonstrates a profound dedication to ethical commitments."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The debate centered on whether upholding these environmental commitments was feasible given the economic constraints."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In a surprising move, the senator chose to oppose the bill, citing moral principles above partisan loyalty."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Activists argue that prioritizing corporate interests over social welfare undermines the foundational principles of equity and justice."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
