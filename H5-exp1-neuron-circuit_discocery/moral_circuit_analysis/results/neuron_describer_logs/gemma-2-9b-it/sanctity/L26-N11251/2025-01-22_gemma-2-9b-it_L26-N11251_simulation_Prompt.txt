Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 26, index 11251 appears to respond to linguistic contexts that involve discussions around principles, commitments, and ethical considerations, particularly in relation to social, political, or ethical themes. The neuron is sensitive to contexts where actions or decisions are framed in terms of ethical commitments or principles, especially when these are juxtaposed with political or social convenience.

### Observed Activations:

1. **Token: '’ and Context: "by a political party you’ve long supported, despite"**
   - **Pattern:** The neuron activates in contexts involving political allegiance and potential contradictions, indicating sensitivity to discussions about loyalty and ethical dilemmas within political affiliations.

2. **Token: 'or' and Context: "must be free to join or leave any political party without"**
   - **Pattern:** The neuron responds to discussions about personal autonomy and freedom of association, particularly in political contexts, highlighting its sensitivity to themes of individual rights and ethical choices.

3. **Token: 'undermine' and Context: "Students who cheat on exams undermine equal opportunity and should face"**
   - **Pattern:** The neuron is triggered by discussions of actions that compromise ethical principles, such as fairness and equal opportunity, indicating sensitivity to ethical breaches.

### New Evidence Analysis:

1. **Text: "The decision to protest against the government's policy highlights a growing commitment to ethical principles over political convenience."**
   - **Activation: 4.000**"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
