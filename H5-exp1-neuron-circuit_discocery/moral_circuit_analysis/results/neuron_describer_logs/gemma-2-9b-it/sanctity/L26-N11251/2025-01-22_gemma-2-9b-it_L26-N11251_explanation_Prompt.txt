Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 26, Neuron: 11251
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 26, index 11251) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by a political party you’ve long supported, despite

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context:  must be free to join or leave any political party without

Token:  undermine	Activation: 10.0	Context: Students who cheat on exams undermine equal opportunity and should face

Token:  fosters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  your own profession or trade fosters personal autonomy.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a commitment to not degrading the environment.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
