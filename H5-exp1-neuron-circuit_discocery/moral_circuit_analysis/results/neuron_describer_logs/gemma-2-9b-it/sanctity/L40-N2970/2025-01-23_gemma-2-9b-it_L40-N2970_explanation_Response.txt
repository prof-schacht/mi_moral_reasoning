=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron (layer 40, index 2970) appears to be highly responsive to certain punctuation marks, beginnings of sentences, and specific words that suggest formality or emphasis in writing. Let's break down the observed activation patterns:

1. **Punctuation and Sentence Boundaries**:
   - **Token '.'**: The neuron activates strongly at the period (.) in the provided contexts. This suggests the neuron responds to the end of sentences, possibly signaling completion or transition.
   - **Token `<bos>`**: The activations at `<bos>` (beginning of sentence) indicate that this neuron might be sensitive to sentence boundaries, specifically the start of new statements. The example with consecutive `<bos>` tokens highlights this sensitivity.

2. **Formal and Emphasizing Words**:
