Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 40, index 2970) demonstrates a selective activation pattern that is more nuanced than initially described. The new evidence suggests that the neuron is specifically responsive to contexts involving formal discussions or categorizations, rather than general punctuation or sentence boundaries. Here's a breakdown of the revised activation patterns:

1. **Punctuation and Sentence Boundaries**:
   - **Token '.'**: The original hypothesis that the neuron activates strongly at periods (.) is not consistently supported by the new evidence. While the neuron did activate in a sentence with a period, it did not activate in other sentences with similar punctuation. This suggests that the neuron's activation is not directly tied to sentence completion or transition.
   - **Token `<bos>`**: Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate at the beginning of sentences, as evidenced by the lack of activation in texts with `<bos>` tokens. This indicates that the neuron is not sensitive to sentence boundaries.

2. **Formal and Emphasizing Words**:
   - **Token 'sports'**: The neuron's activation in the context of "Sports are a vital part of our culture" supports the idea that it responds to formal discussions or categorizations. This aligns with the original observation that the neuron is involved in recognizing emphasis or categorization, particularly in formal contexts.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron appears to be more responsive to contexts that involve formal"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
