=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 40, index 2970) appears to be highly responsive to certain punctuation marks, beginnings of sentences, and specific words that suggest formality or emphasis in writing. Let's break down the observed activation patterns:

1. **Punctuation and Sentence Boundaries**:
   - **Token '.'**: The neuron activates strongly at the period (.) in the provided contexts. This suggests the neuron responds to the end of sentences, possibly signaling completion or transition.
   - **Token `<bos>`**: The activations at `<bos>` (beginning of sentence) indicate that this neuron might be sensitive to sentence boundaries, specifically the start of new statements. The example with consecutive `<bos>` tokens highlights this sensitivity.

2. **Formal and Emphasizing Words**:
   - **Token 'sports'**: The word "sports" appears in a context that describes a broader category or formal discussion, suggesting the neuron's involvement in recognizing emphasis or categorization, especially in formal"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
