=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron (layer 23, index 860) appears to activate primarily for specific word fragments, particularly those ending in "-uting." The neuron shows activation in the context of the tokens "uting" from larger words like "Saluting." Meanwhile, it exhibits no activation for tokens like "ating," " a," or other standalone sounds that lack the specific ending in "-uting."

### Analysis:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The neuron is sensitive to the suffix "-uting." It consistently shows an activation of 0.0 when confronted with other similar-sounding fragments such as "ating" and " a," indicating that these do not trigger the neuron.

2. **Contextual Consistency:**
   - The contexts of the activations "Saluting the flag" and "Saluting superiors" suggest the neuron might be tuned to detect the suffix "-uting" within verbal contexts, possibly pointing to a larger linguistic pattern of identifying words grouped in certain lexical"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
