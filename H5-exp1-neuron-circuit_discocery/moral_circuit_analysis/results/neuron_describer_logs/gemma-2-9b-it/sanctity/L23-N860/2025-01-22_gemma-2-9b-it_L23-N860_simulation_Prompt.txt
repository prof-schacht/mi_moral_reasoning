Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

### Revised Analysis:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The original explanation suggested that the neuron (layer 23, index 860) activates primarily for word fragments ending in "-uting." This is partially supported by the new evidence, as the neuron shows significant activation for sentences containing the word "saluting," with activations of 2.000, 3.000, and 7.000 in different contexts. However, the new evidence also shows activation for words like "commuting" (2.000) and "executing" (8.000), indicating that the neuron is not exclusively sensitive to the fragment "-uting" but rather to a broader set of words ending in "-uting," "-muting," and "-ecuting."

2. **Contextual Consistency:**
   - The original explanation suggested that the neuron might be tuned to detect "-uting" within verbal contexts. The new evidence supports this to some extent, as the neuron activates in contexts involving actions or processes (e.g., "saluting," "executing"). However, the activation for "commuting" suggests that the neuron may also respond to words that denote routine or repetitive actions, not just verbal or ceremonial actions.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances:**
   - The activation for "executing" (8.000) is notably higher than for "saluting" or "commuting," suggesting that the neuron may be more strongly triggered by"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
