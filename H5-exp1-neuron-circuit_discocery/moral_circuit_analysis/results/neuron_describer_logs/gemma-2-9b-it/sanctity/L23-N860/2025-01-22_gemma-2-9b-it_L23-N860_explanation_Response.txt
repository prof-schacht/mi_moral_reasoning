Prompt Type: explanation

=== RESPONSE ===

Based on the provided examples, neuron (layer 23, index 860) appears to activate primarily for specific word fragments, particularly those ending in "-uting." The neuron shows activation in the context of the tokens "uting" from larger words like "Saluting." Meanwhile, it exhibits no activation for tokens like "ating," " a," or other standalone sounds that lack the specific ending in "-uting."

### Analysis:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The neuron is sensitive to the suffix "-uting." It consistently shows an activation of 0.0 when confronted with other similar-sounding fragments such as "ating" and " a," indicating that these do not trigger the neuron.

2. **Contextual Consistency:**
   - The contexts of the activations "Saluting the flag" and "Saluting superiors" suggest the neuron might be tuned to detect the suffix "-uting" within verbal contexts, possibly pointing to a larger linguistic pattern of identifying words grouped in certain lexical
