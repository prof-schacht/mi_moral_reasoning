Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate in contexts related to expressions of obligation, consequence, or formal action. Let's break down the examples to identify the precise pattern:

1. **High Activation with Prepositions ("to", "by"):** 
   - **Token: "to"** with activation of 10.0 in the phrase "come to the aid of a stranger." The preposition "to" here indicates a sense of duty or obligation ("come to the aid"), suggesting action following a conditional or expected behavior.
   - **Token: "by"** with activation of 10.0 in "set by authorities." The preposition "by" emphasizes a rule or condition attributed to an authority, again indicating a structure of obligation or legitimacy.

2. **Legal and Formal Language ("lawful", "act"):**
   - **Token: "lawful"** with activation of 9.0 in "lawful ruling." Here, the word directly relates to legality and formal"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: The new policy was enacted to ensure safety compliance by all employees.
Activation: 2.000
Text: The obligation to attend the meeting was made clear by the manager's announcement.
Activation: 2.000
Text: It was lawful for the committee to initiate the proceedings under the new regulations.
Activation: 2.000
Text: By the terms of the contract, the artist must deliver the final piece by June.
Activation: 1.000
Text: To achieve the best outcome, it is essential to follow the guidelines provided in the manual.
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
