Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question appears to activate in contexts related to expressions of obligation, consequence, or formal action, but with a more nuanced pattern than initially described. Let's refine the explanation based on the new evidence:

1. **Activation with Prepositions ("to", "by"):**
   - The original explanation suggested high activation with prepositions like "to" and "by" in contexts of obligation or authority. However, the new evidence shows lower activation levels (2.0 and 1.0) in sentences where these prepositions are used in contexts of obligation or formal conditions ("obligation to attend," "by the terms of the contract"). This suggests that while these prepositions are relevant, they alone do not strongly trigger the neuron unless accompanied by other specific contextual cues.

2. **Legal and Formal Language ("lawful", "act"):**
   - The original explanation highlighted strong activation with legal and formal language. However, the new evidence shows a low activation (2.0) for "lawful" in a legal context ("lawful for the committee to initiate"). This indicates that the presence of legal terminology alone does not significantly trigger the neuron unless it is part of a more complex structure or context.

3. **Contextual Nuances:**
   - The new evidence reveals that the neuron is more sensitive to the overall context rather than isolated keywords. For instance, the sentence "To achieve the best outcome, it is essential to follow the guidelines provided"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
