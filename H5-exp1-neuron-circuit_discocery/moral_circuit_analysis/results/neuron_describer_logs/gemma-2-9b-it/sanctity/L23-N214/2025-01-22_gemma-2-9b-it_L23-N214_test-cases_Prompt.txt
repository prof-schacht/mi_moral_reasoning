=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate in contexts related to expressions of obligation, consequence, or formal action. Let's break down the examples to identify the precise pattern:

1. **High Activation with Prepositions ("to", "by"):** 
   - **Token: "to"** with activation of 10.0 in the phrase "come to the aid of a stranger." The preposition "to" here indicates a sense of duty or obligation ("come to the aid"), suggesting action following a conditional or expected behavior.
   - **Token: "by"** with activation of 10.0 in "set by authorities." The preposition "by" emphasizes a rule or condition attributed to an authority, again indicating a structure of obligation or legitimacy.

2. **Legal and Formal Language ("lawful", "act"):**
   - **Token: "lawful"** with activation of 9.0 in "lawful ruling." Here, the word directly relates to legality and formal"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
