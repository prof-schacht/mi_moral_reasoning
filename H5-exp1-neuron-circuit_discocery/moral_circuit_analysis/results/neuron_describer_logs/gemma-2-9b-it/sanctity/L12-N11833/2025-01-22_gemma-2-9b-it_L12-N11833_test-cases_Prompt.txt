Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 12, index 11833) appears to be highly responsive to the concept of "purity" and perhaps, in a broader sense, to the themes of sanctity and distinctiveness that are linguistically associated with certain abstract qualities or symbolic terms. Let's break down the activation patterns to understand the neuron's behavior:

1. **Recurrent Token Activation:**
   - The neuron consistently activates strongly at the token "purity." This suggests that the neuron has developed a sensitivity to this specific word, likely due to repeated exposure during training.

2. **Abstract Qualities:**
   - The word "purity" in these contexts signals an abstract qualityâ€”often associated with ideas of cleanliness, innocence, or sanctity. The neuron may have learned to associate the presence of "purity" with these broader conceptual attributes, which are frequently discussed in moral, ceremonial, or symbolic terms.

3. **Contextual Themes:**
   - The contexts provided show that "pur"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
