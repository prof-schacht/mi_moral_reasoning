Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 12, Neuron: 11833
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 12, index 11833) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  purity	Activation: 10.0	Context: tions before religious ceremonies demonstrates purity of intention.

Token:  certain	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in leadership roles have earned certain privileges through their position.

Token:  purity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  newborn is a tradition signifying purity.

Token:  purity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  upholds community standards of purity.

Token:  purity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  substancesâ€”upholds purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
