Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 12, index 11833) exhibits a nuanced sensitivity to the concept of "purity," with a particular emphasis on its moral and emotional connotations rather than purely physical or aesthetic ones. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Sensitivity to Moral and Emotional Connotations:**
   - The neuron shows the highest activation (10.000) in contexts where "purity" is associated with moral or emotional qualities, such as "purity of heart" in the context of resisting corruption. This suggests a strong sensitivity to the moral or virtuous aspects of purity, aligning with themes of sanctity and innocence.

2. **Moderate Activation in Physical and Aesthetic Contexts:**
   - In contexts where "purity" refers to physical or aesthetic qualities, such as "purity of form" in art or "absolute purity" in laboratory samples, the neuron shows moderate activation (5.000). This indicates that while the neuron recognizes these uses of "purity," they do not trigger as strong a response as moral or emotional contexts.

3. **Abstract and Symbolic Associations:**
   - The neuron activates moderately (5.000) when "purity" is used in symbolic or abstract contexts, such as marketing campaigns promoting "purity" of ingredients. This suggests that the neuron associates "purity" with broader symbolic meanings, but these are less impactful than moral contexts"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
