Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The pattern of activation for neuron (layer 36, index 7370) indicates that it responds strongly to certain modal and adverbial verbs or concepts associated with advisability, obligation, or frequency. Here's a detailed analysis of the neuron’s behavior based on the examples provided: 

1. **High Activation on "should":** In the cases where the token "should" appears with an activation of 10.0, the context suggests advisability or obligation. The neuron seems to activate in sentences where directives or recommendations are given, such as in the phrases "should have the right to operate" or "should evaluate employee objectively." This indicates a pattern where the neuron responds to contexts implying necessity or advice.

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "You should always brush your teeth before bed to maintain good dental hygiene."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Employees must always adhere to the company’s code of conduct."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "He should have known better than to ignore the safety instructions."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "You should never underestimate the power of a kind word."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "It's advisable that you should check your oil levels regularly to ensure the car runs smoothly."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
