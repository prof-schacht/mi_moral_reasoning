Neuron (36, 7370) Analysis:

Initial Explanation: The pattern of activation for neuron (layer 36, index 7370) indicates that it responds strongly to certain modal and adverbial verbs or concepts associated with advisability, obligation, or frequency. Here's a detailed analysis of the neuron’s behavior based on the examples provided: 

1. **High Activation on "should":** In the cases where the token "should" appears with an activation of 10.0, the context suggests advisability or obligation. The neuron seems to activate in sentences where directives or recommendations are given, such as in the phrases "should have the right to operate" or "should evaluate employee objectively." This indicates a pattern where the neuron responds to contexts implying necessity or advice.

2. **High Activation on "always":** When the token "always" is present, the neuron also activates with an intensity of 10.0. The context "One should always come to the aid of" suggests a habitual or continuous suggestion or rule. This indicates that the

Revised Explanation: Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The pattern of activation for neuron (layer 36, index 7370) indicates that it does not respond as strongly to modal and adverbial verbs as initially thought. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced behavior, where the neuron is sensitive to specific contexts involving advisability and habitual actions, but not universally to all instances of such verbs. Here's a detailed analysis based on the original and new evidence:

1. **Partial Activation on "should" and "always":** The original explanation suggested high activation for "should" and "always" in contexts implying advisability or obligation. However, the new evidence shows that the neuron does not consistently activate strongly in such contexts. For example, in "You should always brush your teeth before bed to maintain good dental hygiene," the activation is moderate (4.000), indicating that while the neuron recognizes the advisability context, it does not respond as intensely as previously thought. Similarly, "Employees must always adhere to the company’s code of conduct" also results in moderate activation, suggesting that the neuron may be more sensitive to the habitual aspect rather than the obligation itself.

2. **Non-activation on Certain Contexts:** The neuron shows no activation in sentences like "He should have known better than to ignore the safety instructions" and "You should never underestimate the power of a kind word." This suggests that the neuron does not respond to contexts where "should" is used in a retrospective or cautionary sense, or
