Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron seems to activate in contexts related to expressions of respect, deference, or honor within a social or cultural framework. Let's delve into the specifics based on the examples provided:

1. **Token Patterns**: The activation predominantly occurs at tokens that are indicative of verbs or nouns related to the act of showing respect, or maintaining traditional or formal practices ("of", "shows", "rever", "olds"). These words aren't inherently linked by their grammatical category, but by their function in the contextâ€”tying them to the theme of respect or reverence.

2. **Contextual Cues**: The surrounding context of each activation spotlights themes of honoring cultural practices or following traditional protocols. For instance, activating around phrases like "ranking officials", "profanity in sacred spaces", "veterans honors", and "traditional titles" signifies a focus on hierarchical respect and cultural norms.

3. **Consistent Themes**: The common thread across these examples is the notion of respect or"

Text: "During the formal dinner, she meticulously adhered to the etiquette rules, which were seen as a mark of respect for the prestigious guests."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
