Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 32, Neuron: 8112
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 32, index 8112) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context: ranking officials is a sign of respect in some cultures.

Token:  shows	Activation: 10.0	Context:  profanity in sacred spaces shows cultural respect.

Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
