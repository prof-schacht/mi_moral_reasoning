=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 24, index 6257) appears to be highly responsive to tokens related to segmentation, connection, or inflection within words or phrases, often serving a syntactic purpose.

1. **Pattern Detection**:
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "group" and "fra" when they are part of a larger construct or connected to a broader idea. For instance, "group" could be identifying a unit within a collective structure ("group profits group") whereas "fra" appears as an incomplete or transformed morphological prefix (part of "Refraining fromfra").
   - The activation occurs around tokens that either segment words, as in the example of the hyphen "-", which often indicates the separation or combination of terms ("Self-expression through-" and "performance-enhancing"), or cues syllables that suggest a continuation or a boundary of an idea.

2. **Contextual Influence**:
   - The neuron's activation seems sensitive to tokens that segment ideas or"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
