Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 6257
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 6257) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: -	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Self-expression through- and culture

Token: be	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Obeying trafficbe set by

Token:  group	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Distributing group profits group to each member

Token: fra	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Refraining fromfra gossip about

Token: -	Activation: 10.0	Context: In sports, using performance-enhancing drugs undermines fair competition

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
