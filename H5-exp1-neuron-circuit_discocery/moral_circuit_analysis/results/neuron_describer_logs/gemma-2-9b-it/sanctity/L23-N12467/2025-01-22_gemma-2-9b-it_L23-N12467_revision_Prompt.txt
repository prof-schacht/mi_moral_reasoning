Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to be detecting a specific linguistic pattern that involves the fostering or promotion of social structures, relationships, or principles within a given context. Based on the high-activation examples provided, let's break down the observations:

1. **Common Theme in Activations**:
   - The context of each activation surrounds concepts related to social cohesion and fundamental principles of interaction or relationships. Each active token seems to be part of a phrase that discusses maintaining or fostering a certain desirable quality or structure (e.g., harmony, loyalty, trust).

2. **Specific Linguistic Patterns**:
   - The active tokens ('of', 'social', 'a', 'true', 'term') are part of phrases that describe fostering some form of connection or principle:
     - "Basic principle of household authority" (Token: 'of')
     - "Fosters social harmony" (Token: 'social')
     - "Ensure a cohesive chain of command" (Token: 'a')
     - "F"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The cornerstone of community engagement is fostering mutual trust and respect among its members."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Promoting a culture of transparency and honesty is crucial for long-term organizational success."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "A key aspect of societal development involves nurturing relationships that are built on empathy and understanding."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "To maintain a stable governance, it is essential to uphold a system of checks and balances."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In a true sense of collaboration, the team members must support each other through open dialogue and shared goals."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
