Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 12467
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 12467) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  children as a basic principle of household authority.

Token:  social	Activation: 10.0	Context:  showing respect to elders fosters social harmony.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  must be followed to ensure a cohesive chain of command.

Token:  true	Activation: 10.0	Context:  friends in difficult times fosters true loyalty.

Token: term	Activation: 10.0	Context:  partners fairly fosters long-term trust.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
