Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question is primarily detecting linguistic patterns that emphasize the promotion and maintenance of social structures, relationships, and principles, particularly those that involve mutual support, trust, and collaboration. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific nuances in the neuron's activation patterns.

1. **Supported Aspects of the Original Explanation**:
   - The neuron continues to show high activation in contexts that discuss fostering social cohesion and fundamental principles of interaction. This is evident in phrases that emphasize mutual trust, respect, transparency, and collaboration.
   - The concept of fostering desirable qualities or structures, such as harmony and trust, remains central to the neuron's activation.

2. **Aspects to be Modified or Removed**:
   - The original explanation's focus on specific tokens like 'of', 'social', 'a', 'true', and 'term' needs refinement. The new evidence suggests that the neuron is not triggered by these tokens in isolation but rather by their role in conveying broader themes of social cohesion and mutual support.
   - The emphasis on specific tokens should be shifted to the overall thematic context of the phrases.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances Revealed**:
   - The neuron shows high activation in contexts that explicitly mention fostering mutual trust, respect, and collaboration, as seen in phrases like "fostering mutual trust and respect" and "a true sense of collaboration."
   - The neuron is less sensitive to phrases that discuss structural aspects"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
