=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to be detecting a specific linguistic pattern that involves the fostering or promotion of social structures, relationships, or principles within a given context. Based on the high-activation examples provided, let's break down the observations:

1. **Common Theme in Activations**:
   - The context of each activation surrounds concepts related to social cohesion and fundamental principles of interaction or relationships. Each active token seems to be part of a phrase that discusses maintaining or fostering a certain desirable quality or structure (e.g., harmony, loyalty, trust).

2. **Specific Linguistic Patterns**:
   - The active tokens ('of', 'social', 'a', 'true', 'term') are part of phrases that describe fostering some form of connection or principle:
     - "Basic principle of household authority" (Token: 'of')
     - "Fosters social harmony" (Token: 'social')
     - "Ensure a cohesive chain of command" (Token: 'a')
     - "F"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
