Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 29, Neuron: 2067
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 29, index 2067) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  compassion	Activation: 10.0	Context:  protesting cruel testing methods shows compassion.

Token:  compassion	Activation: 10.0	Context:  families is an act of compassion.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context: Keeping personal confessions secret out of respect for your friend’

Token:  empathy	Activation: 10.0	Context:  who’s upset fosters empathy and connection.

Token:  empathy	Activation: 10.0	Context:  giving them care demonstrates moral empathy.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
