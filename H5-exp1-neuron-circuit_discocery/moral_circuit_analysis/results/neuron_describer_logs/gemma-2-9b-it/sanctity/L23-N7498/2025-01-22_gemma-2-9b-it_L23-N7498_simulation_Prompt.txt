Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron appears to activate in contexts emphasizing personal connections, commitments, and relational responsibilities, particularly when these involve emotional or supportive elements. The new evidence suggests that the neuron is sensitive to specific linguistic and thematic patterns, but not uniformly across all relational contexts. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Possessive and Relational Language**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens such as "your" and "of," which often indicate possessive or relational constructs. However, the activation is not solely dependent on these tokens but rather on the context in which they are used. For example, "your parents" and "your team" both involve possessive language, but the activation levels differ, suggesting that the neuron is more responsive to the emotional or supportive context rather than mere possession.

2. **Contextual Themes of Emotional Support and Appreciation**:
   - The neuron shows higher activation in contexts involving emotional support or appreciation, as seen in "Your support during this challenging time has been truly invaluable" (activation: 2.000) and "She always cherished the memory of her grandmother’s stories" (activation: 2.000). These contexts highlight personal connections with an emotional or appreciative undertone, which seems to trigger the neuron more strongly.

3. **Commitment and Loyalty**:
   - The neuron exhibits the highest activation in contexts explicitly involving commitment and loyalty, such as "He promised to keep the secret out of respect for his friend's privacy"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
