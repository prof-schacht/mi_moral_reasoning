Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to activate in contexts where there is an emphasis on relationships and responsibilities associated with personal connections or commitments. The activations suggest a pattern where the neuron is triggered by linguistic constructions that highlight relational or possessive implications, often involving actions or commitments towards others. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Possessive and Relational Language**:
   - The neuron activates strongly on tokens such as "your" and "of" which are indicative of possessive or relational constructs. These tokens often signify ownership or association with a personal or relational element (e.g., "your friend’s privacy").

2. **Contextual Themes of Loyalty and Responsibility**:
   - For the token "your" in the example with context relating to "friend’s privacy" and "childhood sports," the activation points to an interest in personal and relational commitments. The context involves confidentiality ("secret out of respect for your friend’s privacy") and support ("Supporting your childhood sports"), highlighting actions based on interpersonal responsibility"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Remember to check in on your parents regularly to ensure their well-being."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "He promised to keep the secret out of respect for his friend's privacy, showing deep commitment."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The success of the project depends heavily on your team's collaboration and dedication."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "She always cherished the memory of her grandmother’s stories, feeling a strong personal connection."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Your support during this challenging time has been truly invaluable and deeply appreciated."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
