=== RESPONSE ===

### Typical Cases

**Test case 1:**  
"She offered a comforting hug to her friend who was going through a tough time, ensuring her support was felt."

*(Tests if implicit actions and concepts of loyalty without explicit supportive actions trigger activation.)*

**Test case 9:**  
"From those quiet moments of shared grief, a profound bond of empathy emerged."  
*(Tests if sentences that emphasize relational concepts over actions still trigger neuron activation.)*

**Test case 10:**  
"In that moment, his reassuring presence was all that mattered."  
*(Tests if sentences that rely heavily on context rather than explicit supportive actions or words trigger activation.)*
