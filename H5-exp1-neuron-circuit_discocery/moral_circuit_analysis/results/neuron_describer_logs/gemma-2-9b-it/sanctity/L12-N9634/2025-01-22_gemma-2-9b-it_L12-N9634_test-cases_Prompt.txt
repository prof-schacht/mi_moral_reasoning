Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron shows high activation in contexts related to expressions of empathy, loyalty, and supportive interactions. Each example represents a specific grammatical and semantic pattern where language emphasizes relational or supportive actions and concepts.

### Patterns and Concepts:
1. **Grammatical Context:**
   - The neuron often activates with prepositions ("to," "in," "from") and auxiliary verbs ("is"), indicating it may track grammatical structures that signal relationships and states of being.
   - These triggers often appear in contexts where the sentence describes interactions or behaviors between individuals or states of being.

2. **Semantic Context:**
   - The surrounding context typically involves caring or protective actions and concepts. Words like "comforting hug," "respectful silence," "emotional support," "privacy," and "defending" suggest actions that signify empathy, protection, and loyalty.
   - The activation tends to occur in instances where the sentence structure is completed by describing a human relational action (e.g., "hug," "silence"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
