=== RESPONSE ===

Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 35, index 4378, primarily responds to tokens that function as prepositions within a sentence, particularly those that introduce prepositional phrases providing additional context or information. The new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns, emphasizing its sensitivity to specific prepositions and their contextual roles rather than conjunctions.

1. **Prepositional Phrases**: The neuron consistently activates at prepositions such as "through," "in," and "of," which introduce prepositional phrases that add context or detail to the sentence. This pattern is strongly supported by the test cases:
   - "Through hard work and determination" shows high activation (3.000), indicating the neuron's sensitivity to prepositions that denote means or methods.
   - "In the garden" and "of ancient spells" both trigger significant activation (2.000 and 3.000, respectively), highlighting the neuron's focus on locational and descriptive contexts.

2. **Conjunction Uses**: The original explanation suggested that the neuron responds to conjunctions like "when." However, the new evidence shows a lower activation (2.000) for "when the rain started pouring," indicating that conjunctions may not be a primary trigger for this neuron. This suggests that the neuron's sensitivity to conjunctions is less pronounced than initially thought.

3. **Nuances and Exceptions**: The test case "Although tired, he continued his journey"
