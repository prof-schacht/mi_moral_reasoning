=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to tokens that indicate key attributes or roles within a context that involves evaluation, significance, or capacity. Let's explore each example to uncover the precise pattern triggering the activation:

1. **Token: true** - Activation is triggered around the assertion of an attribute or condition (e.g., "true fairness"). Here, "true" is used to emphasize authenticity or accuracy, giving it a role of validation or description.

4. **Token: part** - Here, it represents a component of a"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
