=== RESPONSE ===

Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron responds to tokens that emphasize key attributes or roles within contexts involving evaluation, significance, or capacity, particularly when these tokens highlight importance, authenticity, or essential components. The new evidence supports and refines this understanding by showing specific patterns of activation:

1. **Token: true** - The neuron activates when "true" is used to emphasize authenticity or core essence, as seen in phrases like "true value" and "true essence." The activation is moderate (2.000), suggesting that while "true" contributes to the neuron's activation, it is not the sole trigger but rather part of a broader context emphasizing authenticity or fundamental qualities.

2. **Token: significance** - The neuron shows strong activation (4.000) when "significance" is used to denote importance or value, particularly in contexts where the role or impact of an individual or concept is highlighted. This supports the original explanation that the neuron responds to tokens emphasizing importance or prominence.

3. **Token: gratitude** - The neuron activates significantly (3.000) when "gratitude" is used in contexts emphasizing its role in social interactions and relationships. This aligns with the original explanation that the neuron responds to expressions of emotion that acknowledge value or benefit, reinforcing the importance of gratitude in social and moral contexts.

4. **Token: part** - The neuron activates (3.000) when "part" is used to denote an essential component of a process or system, particularly when
