Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 14, Neuron: 9283
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 14, index 9283) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  true	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of their status, is true fairness.

Token:  significance	Activation: 10.0	Context:  honors their historical and cultural significance.

Token:  gratitude	Activation: 10.0	Context:  blessing before meals can express gratitude and sanctify nourishment.

Token:  part	Activation: 10.0	Context:  heard first in meetings as part of the hierarchy.

Token:  handle	Activation: 10.0	Context:  because they are trained to handle crises.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
