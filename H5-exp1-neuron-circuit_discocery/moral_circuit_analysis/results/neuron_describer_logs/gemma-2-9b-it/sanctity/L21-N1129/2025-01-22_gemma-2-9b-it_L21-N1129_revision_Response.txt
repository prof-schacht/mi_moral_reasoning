Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 21, index 1129) primarily detects linguistic patterns associated with personal and social responsibilities, obligations, and expressions of respect. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of its activation triggers.

1. **Patterns that Trigger Activation:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation for phrases that emphasize a collective or universal responsibility, particularly when the responsibility is framed as a moral or ethical imperative. For instance, "a responsibility that we all must embrace" and "a moral commitment deeply rooted in tradition" both trigger high activation levels (9.000 and 6.000, respectively). This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to expressions of shared or communal duties.
   - It also responds to the concept of duty when it is linked to broader societal or ethical contexts, as seen in "duty of every citizen" (activation 5.000) and "expressing loyalty" (activation 6.000).

2. **Patterns that Do Not Trigger Strong Activation:**
   - The neuron exhibits lower activation when the concept of obligation is tied to individual roles or leadership, as seen in "obligation of a leader" (activation 2.000). This indicates that the neuron is less responsive to responsibilities framed in a hierarchical or individual context.
   - Similarly, when duty is mentioned in a more abstract or philosophical context, such as "the concept of duty often intertwines with personal goals," the activation is
