Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 21, index 1129) appears to be detecting concepts related to personal and social responsibilities, obligations, and expressions of respect, particularly as expressed through linguistic patterns.

1. **Exact Pattern that Triggers Activation:**
   - The neuron activates robustly for tokens that indicate a sense of duty or responsibility ("duty," "obligation"), which are central to the idea of obligations or moral commitments. It responds to words that denote responsibilities that individuals or societies uphold.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - In each activation, the token is situated within a broader context that involves an action or expectation: "a duty of a compassionate community," "a moral obligation," "expressing loyalty," and "respect for oneâ€™s body." These phrases introduce a scenario where there is an understood expectation of behavior or sentiment that reflects moral or ethical considerations.
   - The activations on the word "of" appear in phrases following similar patterns; "the sanctity"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "It is the duty of every citizen to contribute to the betterment of society."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The obligation of a leader is to serve with integrity and respect for all individuals."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Expressing loyalty to one's heritage is a moral commitment deeply rooted in tradition."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "A profound respect for nature is a responsibility that we all must embrace."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "The concept of duty often intertwines with personal goals, creating a complex web of motivations."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
