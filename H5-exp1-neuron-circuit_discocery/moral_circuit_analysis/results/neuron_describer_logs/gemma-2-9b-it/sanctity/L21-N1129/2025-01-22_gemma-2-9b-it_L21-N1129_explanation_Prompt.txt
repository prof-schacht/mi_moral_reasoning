Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 1129
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 1129) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  duty	Activation: 10.0	Context:  from harsh weather is a duty of a compassionate community.

Token:  obligation	Activation: 10.0	Context:  ensure cleanliness is a moral obligation.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  partner is a key expression of loyalty.

Token:  respect	Activation: 10.0	Context:  personal hygiene and cleanliness shows respect for oneâ€™s body

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
