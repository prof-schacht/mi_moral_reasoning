=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 21, index 1129) appears to be detecting concepts related to personal and social responsibilities, obligations, and expressions of respect, particularly as expressed through linguistic patterns.

1. **Exact Pattern that Triggers Activation:**
   - The neuron activates robustly for tokens that indicate a sense of duty or responsibility ("duty," "obligation"), which are central to the idea of obligations or moral commitments. It responds to words that denote responsibilities that individuals or societies uphold.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - In each activation, the token is situated within a broader context that involves an action or expectation: "a duty of a compassionate community," "a moral obligation," "expressing loyalty," and "respect for oneâ€™s body." These phrases introduce a scenario where there is an understood expectation of behavior or sentiment that reflects moral or ethical considerations.
   - The activations on the word "of" appear in phrases following similar patterns; "the sanctity"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
