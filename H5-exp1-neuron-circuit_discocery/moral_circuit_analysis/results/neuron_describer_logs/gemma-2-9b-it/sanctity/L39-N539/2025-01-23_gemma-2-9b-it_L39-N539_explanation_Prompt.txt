Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 39, Neuron: 539
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 39, index 539) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  basic	Activation: 10.0	Context:  loss is a sign of basic human compassion.

Token:  any	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should be free to practice any religion or none at all

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: Adults should have the liberty to make informed decisions about drug

Token:  are	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a job if working conditions are poor is an essential liberty

Token:  real	Activation: 10.0	Context: , unless they have done real harm, is a sign

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
