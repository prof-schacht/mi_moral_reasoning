Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 39, index 539) appears to be responsive to linguistic constructions that emphasize fundamental human rights and freedoms, particularly when these are articulated as basic principles or assertions about liberty and justice. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced activation pattern than initially described.

1. **Token Patterns:**
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens such as "basic" and "right," especially when these words are part of phrases that explicitly state fundamental rights or freedoms. This is evident in the high activation for phrases like "basic right to express" and "basic human rights."
   - The token "to" does not consistently trigger activation unless it is part of a phrase that directly asserts a fundamental right or freedom, as seen in the lack of activation in the phrase "to deny anyone the opportunity."

2. **Surrounding Context:**
   - **"basic"**: The neuron is activated when "basic" is used in conjunction with explicit rights or freedoms, such as "basic right to express" or "basic human rights." This suggests a focus on foundational rights rather than general ethical behavior.
   - **"any"**: While the original explanation suggested activation with "any" in contexts of universal principles, the new evidence does not support this. The phrase "any society to uphold" resulted in lower activation, indicating that the presence of "any" alone is insufficient for triggering the neuron.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
