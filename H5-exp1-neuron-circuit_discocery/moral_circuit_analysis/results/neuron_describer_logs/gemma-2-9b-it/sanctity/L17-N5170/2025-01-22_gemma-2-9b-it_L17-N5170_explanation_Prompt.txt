Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 5170
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 5170) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  imb	Activation: 10.0	Context:  as a sacred union can imbue relationships with reverence.

Token:  demonstrates	Activation: 10.0	Context:  keeping them free from pollutants demonstrates reverence.

Token:  by	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a mentorâ€™s expertise by following their advice demonstrates respect

Token: ishing	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Punishing tax fraudishing the wealthy

Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context: 't eaten in days is a basic human kindness.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
