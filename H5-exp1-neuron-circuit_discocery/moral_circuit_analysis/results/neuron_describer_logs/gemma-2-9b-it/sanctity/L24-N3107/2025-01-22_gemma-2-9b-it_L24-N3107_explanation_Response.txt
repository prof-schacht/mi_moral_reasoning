=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron (layer 24, index 3107) appears to be highly responsive to the linguistic context involving the token "olding," particularly as it appears at the end of certain words. The activations indicate that it is sensitive to this suffix-like appearance in various contexts. Let's break down the activation pattern:

1. **Suffix Sensitivity**: The neuron activates strongly when encountering the sequence "olding" within a word, such as "Upholding." This suggests that it is attuned to words ending with this particular string of characters.

3. **Structural Pattern**: In each activation, the token "olding" is part of a word structure that conveys ongoing or continuous action (gerund or participle forms
