=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 23, index 4010) appears to be highly sensitive to certain linguistic or syntactic patterns, particularly those involving the closing of a thought or sentence. Let's break down the activations based on the provided examples:

1. **Token: "ations" in "graduations":** This token represents the ending of a longer noun typically used in formal contexts, such as "graduations" within the context of important milestones. The neuron activates due to the presence of a suffix commonly used in formal, concluding terms.

2. **Token: "address":** The activation occurs in the context of phrases that emphasize formal or traditional structures, often used to conclude an idea regarding social etiquette and respect. The neuron likely acknowledges completion in ideas about societal norms or formal recognition.

3. **Tokens: period "." as sentence ends:** The repeated high activations when encountering sentence-ending periods indicates the neuron's sensitivity to sentence boundaries, particularly when these periods follow statements that might diplomatically"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
