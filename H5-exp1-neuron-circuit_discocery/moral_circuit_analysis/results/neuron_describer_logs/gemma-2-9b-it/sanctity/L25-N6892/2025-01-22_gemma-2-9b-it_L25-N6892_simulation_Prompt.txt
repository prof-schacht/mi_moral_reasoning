Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron appears to respond to specific grammatical constructions involving determiners and prepositions, with a particular focus on their role within English sentence structures that emphasize obligation, timing, and careful handling.

1. **Activation on "the":**
   - The original explanation suggested strong activation on "the" when it functions as a definite article introducing a noun phrase in contexts establishing a standard or norm. However, the new evidence does not strongly support this pattern, as the activation levels in sentences with "the" are relatively low (e.g., "The committee decided to adhere to the standards" with an activation of 4.000). This suggests that while "the" may play a role, it is not a primary trigger for high activation.

2. **Activation on "to":**
   - The original explanation highlighted activation on "to" in semi-idiomatic or transitional phrases involving obligation or ethical considerations. The new evidence supports this, particularly in contexts where "to" introduces actions or commitments (e.g., "They were instructed to the utmost care" with an activation of 9.000). This indicates that the neuron's activation is indeed sensitive to contexts where "to" is part of phrases emphasizing careful handling or obligation.

3. **Activation on "before":**
   - The new evidence shows strong activation on "before" in contexts related to timing and preparation (e.g., "Before the sun rises, the fishermen prepare" with an activation of"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
