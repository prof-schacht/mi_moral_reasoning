Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 20, index 12225) appears to be highly responsive to certain prepositions and conjunctions—namely "of," "to," "during," and "for"—when they occur in contexts that suggest a normative, value-laden, or ethically charged scenario. This indicates that the neuron is likely detecting a specific linguistic pattern related to expressions of moral, ethical, or procedural obligations and their justification.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The neuron activates consistently with prepositions or conjunctions that connect two ideas, where one expresses a normative duty, principle, or requirement. These tokens ("of," "to," "during," "for") serve as linguistic markers indicating a link between an action, policy, or process and a broader moral or social justification. Essentially, the neuron seems to recognize contexts where there is an implicit or explicit reason or rationale given for an action or state of being.

2. **Contextual Activation:**
   - In"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The policy of providing free healthcare to all citizens during emergencies is justified by the principle of equality and fairness."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "For the purpose of enhancing public safety, the new regulations were implemented to ensure compliance with international standards."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The committee's decision to delay the project was based on the need for further ethical review of the environmental impact."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "During the meeting, we discussed the necessity of adhering to our code of conduct, as it aligns with our organizational values."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The obligation to report any form of misconduct is essential for maintaining transparency within the organization."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
