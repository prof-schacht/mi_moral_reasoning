=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 20, index 12225) appears to be highly responsive to certain prepositions and conjunctions—namely "of," "to," "during," and "for"—when they occur in contexts that suggest a normative, value-laden, or ethically charged scenario. This indicates that the neuron is likely detecting a specific linguistic pattern related to expressions of moral, ethical, or procedural obligations and their justification.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The neuron activates consistently with prepositions or conjunctions that connect two ideas, where one expresses a normative duty, principle, or requirement. These tokens ("of," "to," "during," "for") serve as linguistic markers indicating a link between an action, policy, or process and a broader moral or social justification. Essentially, the neuron seems to recognize contexts where there is an implicit or explicit reason or rationale given for an action or state of being.

2. **Contextual Activation:**
   - In"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
