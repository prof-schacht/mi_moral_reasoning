Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 20, index 12225) demonstrates a nuanced responsiveness to linguistic patterns involving prepositions and conjunctions, particularly in contexts that suggest ethical, procedural, or normative scenarios. However, the new evidence reveals specific conditions under which the neuron activates more strongly, refining our understanding of its behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The neuron is indeed sensitive to prepositions and conjunctions such as "of," "to," "during," and "for," but its activation is more pronounced when these words are part of a context that explicitly involves ethical review or adherence to organizational values. The presence of these prepositions alone is insufficient for high activation; they must be part of a sentence that directly ties actions or decisions to ethical principles or organizational norms.

2. **Contextual Activation:**
   - The neuron shows high activation (6.000) in contexts where there is a clear ethical or normative evaluation, such as the need for ethical review or adherence to values ("The committee's decision to delay the project was based on the need for further ethical review of the environmental impact" and "During the meeting, we discussed the necessity of adhering to our code of conduct, as it aligns with our organizational values").
   - Moderate activation (4.000) occurs in scenarios where ethical principles are mentioned but are not the primary focus, as seen in the justification of policies by principles of equality and fairness.
   - Lower activation (2
