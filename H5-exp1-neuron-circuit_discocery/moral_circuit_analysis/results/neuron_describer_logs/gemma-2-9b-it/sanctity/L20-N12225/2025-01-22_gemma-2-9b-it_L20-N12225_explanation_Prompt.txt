Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 20, Neuron: 12225
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 20, index 12225) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  supports the well-being of families.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  sacred topics is a sign of reverence.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  transparent election process is critical to fair governance.

Token:  during	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to check on elderly neighbors during severe weather is morally right

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  be counted accurately and fairly for each candidate.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
