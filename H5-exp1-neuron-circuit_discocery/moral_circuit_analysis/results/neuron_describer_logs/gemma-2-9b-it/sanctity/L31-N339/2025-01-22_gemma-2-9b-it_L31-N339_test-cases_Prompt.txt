=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples and their activation patterns, neuron (layer 31, index 339) appears to focus on linguistic structures that highlight conditional or explanatory relationships, particularly those involving acknowledgment or reinforcement of sentiments, actions, or states.

1. **Pattern Trigger**: The neuron activates in response to tokens that are often central to constructing clauses that link statements of possibility, explanation, or characteristics, such as "can," "is," and punctuation (e.g., periods) that might indicate the end of a conclusive statement. The token "empathy" suggests the neuron's interest in emotional or morally significant contexts.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - In the case of "can" and "is," the neuron activates at conjunctions or verbs that connect subject matter with their descriptive or normative states (e.g., "can reduce their distress," "is a sign of reverence," "is a sign of basic human"). These tokens often precede or conclude expressions that explain ability"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
