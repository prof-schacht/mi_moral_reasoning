Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 23, index 86, appears to respond to nouns that relate to structured systems or entities, often within formal or institutional contexts. Here's a breakdown of the observed pattern:

1. **Token Type**: The activations are triggered by specific noun tokens that typically refer to aspects of organizational or formal structures. These include "forms," "offices," "direction," "staff," and "community."

2. **Contextual Associations**: 
    - **Organizational Entities**: Words like "offices" and "staff" imply a structured setup involving people within an organization or workplace. These terms are often used within a context where roles and functions are delineated.
    - **Guidance and Norms**: "Direction" and "community" suggest roles or systems providing guidance, moral or otherwise, or embodying collective norms.
    - **Traditional or Standard Constructs**: "Forms," as referenced in the context of "traditional forms of address," refers"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: The committee outlined new forms for the staff to fill out, ensuring everyone's role in the community was well-documented.
Activation: 7.000
Text: In the bustling offices of the corporation, the staff worked diligently to maintain the structured order of operations.
Activation: 4.000
Text: The community gathered to discuss the new direction in which their traditional forms of governance were heading.
Activation: 5.000
Text: The forms required for the legal proceedings were complex, reflecting the intricate structure of the judicial system.
Activation: 4.000
Text: Her position in the community was pivotal, providing direction and structure through her various roles.
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
