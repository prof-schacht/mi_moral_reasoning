=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 25, index 9649 appears to respond to tokens that are part of or closely related to specific syntactic or functional patterns within a sentence. Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions**: The neuron activates strongly for the tokens "for" and "in", which are prepositions, and serve as connectors within a sentence. These words are important for establishing relationships between different parts of a sentence, which might be significant for this neuron's function.

2. **Common Morphemes or Affixes**: The activation for "ining" suggests a sensitivity to morphological patterns, specifically involving suffixes that might be part of larger words. In the context "fromining," the neuron detects the morpheme "-ining," even if itâ€™s part of a non-standard construction, suggesting it could be picking up on ing- or in- suffix patterns common in English.

3. **Plural/Singular Suffix"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
