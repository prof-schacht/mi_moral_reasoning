Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, the neuron in layer 25, index 9649 appears to respond to specific syntactic and morphological patterns within a sentence. Here's a refined breakdown of the neuron's behavior:

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions**: The original explanation suggested a strong activation for prepositions like "for" and "in". The new evidence partially supports this, as seen in sentences where these words appear. However, the activation levels vary significantly, indicating that the presence of these prepositions alone is not the sole trigger. For instance, "for" in "She loved dancing for its own sake, not for the applause" results in a higher activation (3.000) compared to "The cat sat for hours in the garden" (1.000), suggesting additional contextual factors influence activation.

2. **Contextual and Functional Patterns**: The neuron seems to respond more strongly when prepositions are part of more complex or abstract expressions. For example, "Running in circles, he pondered the meaning of life" yields a high activation (7.000), indicating that the neuron's response is heightened in contexts involving introspection or abstract concepts. This suggests that the neuron may be sensitive to the functional role of prepositions in conveying deeper meanings or relationships.

3. **Morphological Sensitivity**: The original explanation noted sensitivity to morphemes like "-ining". While the new evidence does not directly test this, the varied"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
