=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron in layer 25, index 9649 appears to respond to tokens that are part of or closely related to specific syntactic or functional patterns within a sentence. Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions**: The neuron activates strongly for the tokens "for" and "in", which are prepositions, and serve as connectors within a sentence. These words are important for establishing relationships between different parts of a sentence, which might be significant for this neuron's function.

2. **Common Morphemes or Affixes**: The activation for "ining" suggests a sensitivity to morphological patterns, specifically involving suffixes that might be part of larger words. In the context "fromining," the neuron detects the morpheme "-ining," even if itâ€™s part of a non-standard construction, suggesting it could be picking up on ing- or in- suffix patterns common in English.

3. **Plural/Singular Suffix"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The cat sat for hours in the garden, watching the birds."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "She loved dancing for its own sake, not for the applause."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In the midst of chaos, he found inner peace."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Running in circles, he pondered the meaning of life."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The committee was known for its indecisiveness during the meetings."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
