Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 13083
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 13083) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  commitment	Activation: 10.0	Context:  vegan lifestyle can reflect a commitment to purity.

Token:  at	Activation: 10.0	Context:  practice any religion or none at all, without persecution.

Token:  variety	Activation: 10.0	Context:  from diverse sources fosters cultural variety.

Token: re	Activation: 10.0	Context:  household tasks when they’re injured demonstrates caring solidarity.

Token:  like	Activation: 10.0	Context: ’s important milestones, like graduations or weddings,

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
