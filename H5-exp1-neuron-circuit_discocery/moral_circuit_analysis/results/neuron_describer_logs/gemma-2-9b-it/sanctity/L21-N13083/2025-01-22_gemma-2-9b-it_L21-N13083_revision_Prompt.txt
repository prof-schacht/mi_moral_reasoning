=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 21, index 13083 appears to be responding to concepts that emphasize inclusivity, connection, or shared experiences within a broad and collaborative context. Here's a breakdown of how the neuron activates based on the examples given:

1. **Token Analysis**:
   - **Commitment**: The context of "a commitment to purity" suggests a strong alignment with a set of values or principles that are part of a collective effort or belief system.
   - **At**: The phrase "without persecution" in "practice any religion or none at all" indicates freedom and inclusion in a diverse spectrum of religious practices and beliefs.

   - **Re**: In "when theyâ€™re injured demonstrates caring solidarity," the focus seems to reflect actions that unite or support individuals communally.
   - **Like**: The context "important milestones, like graduations or"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Our community thrives on a commitment to inclusivity, ensuring everyone feels welcome and valued."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The festival celebrates cultural variety, offering workshops and performances from around the world."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "He believes in a collaborative approach to problem-solving, where each voice is heard and respected."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The initiative promotes peace and understanding among nations, advocating for global cooperation."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "At the heart of their friendship is a shared experience of overcoming challenges together."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
