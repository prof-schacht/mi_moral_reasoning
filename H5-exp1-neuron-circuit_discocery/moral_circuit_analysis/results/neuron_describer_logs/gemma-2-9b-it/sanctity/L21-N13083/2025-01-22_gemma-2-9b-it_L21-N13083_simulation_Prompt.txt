Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 21, index 13083 appears to be highly responsive to themes of inclusivity, diversity, and collaborative efforts, particularly in contexts that emphasize collective experiences and mutual support. The new evidence provides a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - **Inclusivity and Diversity**: The neuron strongly activates in contexts that emphasize inclusivity and cultural variety, as seen in the high activation scores for phrases like "a commitment to inclusivity" and "cultural variety." This supports the original explanation that the neuron responds to themes of diversity and acceptance.
   - **Collaborative Efforts**: The neuron also shows strong activation for phrases that highlight collaborative approaches, such as "collaborative approach to problem-solving," indicating a sensitivity to contexts where collective input and cooperation are valued.

2. **Modified or Removed Aspects**:
   - **Shared Experiences**: While the original explanation suggested a focus on shared experiences, the new evidence indicates that the neuron is less responsive to this theme alone, as seen in the moderate activation for "shared experience of overcoming challenges together." This suggests that shared experiences need to be coupled with broader themes of inclusivity or collaboration to trigger strong activation.
   - **Global Cooperation**: The activation for "promotes peace and understanding among nations" is moderate, suggesting that while global cooperation is relevant, it is not as strong a trigger as more direct themes of inclus"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
