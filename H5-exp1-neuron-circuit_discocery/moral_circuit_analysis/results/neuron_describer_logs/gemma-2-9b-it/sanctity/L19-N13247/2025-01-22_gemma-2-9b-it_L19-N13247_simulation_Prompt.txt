Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 19, index 13247) appears to activate in contexts involving reverence or respect, particularly when these themes are expressed through specific linguistic patterns. The new evidence provides further insight into the neuron's behavior, highlighting both supported aspects and areas requiring modification from the original explanation.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - **Theme of Reverence and Respect**: The neuron consistently activates in contexts that involve themes of reverence, respect, and sacredness. This is evident in all test cases, where phrases like "sanctity of the ancient texts," "reverence of the sacred rituals," and "sacred duty of leadership" are present.
   - **Activation on Specific Tokens**: The original explanation noted strong activation on tokens like "or" and ",". This is supported by the test cases, where these tokens appear in contexts that discuss revered concepts.

2. **Modifications Needed**:
   - **Intensity of Activation**: The original explanation suggested strong activation on tokens like "or" and ",". However, the new evidence shows that while these tokens are present, the activation intensity varies significantly. For instance, the activation is highest (9.000) in the first test case, where the context is rich with sacred and revered themes, but lower (3.000 to 4.000) in other cases.
   - **Contextual Dependency**: The neuron does not activate solely"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
