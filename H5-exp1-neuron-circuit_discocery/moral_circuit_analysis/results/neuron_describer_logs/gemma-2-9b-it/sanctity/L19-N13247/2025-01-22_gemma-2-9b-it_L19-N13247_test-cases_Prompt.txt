=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 19, index 13247) seems to primarily activate in contexts involving the theme of reverence or respect, specifically tied to linguistic patterns associated with sacredness, solemnity, or respect for important concepts or objects. Let's break down its behavior based on the examples provided:

1. **Recurrent Tokens and Activation**:
   - The neuron activates strongly on specific tokens like "or," ",", and "sanctity." The context around these tokens is crucial to understanding the neuron's trigger patterns. 

2. **Specific Linguistic Patterns**:
   - **Conjunctions and Lists**:
     - The neuron activates on the token "or" and the comma (",") which often serve as connectors in lists or separate clauses concerning revered concepts (e.g., satires of powerful figures, sacred texts). In this pattern, the linguistic structure introduces or segregates ideas that carry an inherent sense of importance or respect.
   
   - **Sacred and Sole"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
