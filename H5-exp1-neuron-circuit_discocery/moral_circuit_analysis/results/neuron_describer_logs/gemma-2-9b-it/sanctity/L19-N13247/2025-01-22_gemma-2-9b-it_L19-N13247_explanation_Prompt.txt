Layer: 19, Neuron: 13247
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 13247) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context: Some ceremonies, like weddings, are sacred and should be

Token:  or	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Expressing satire or or of powerful figures is

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  objects, like sacred texts, with careful respect is important

Token:  sanctity	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Respecting the sanctity sanctity oneâ€™s own

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
