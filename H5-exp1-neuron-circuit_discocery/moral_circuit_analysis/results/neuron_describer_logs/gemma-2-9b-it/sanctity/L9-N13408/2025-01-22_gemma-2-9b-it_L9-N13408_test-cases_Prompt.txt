=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 9, index 13408) appears to be responsive to a particular linguistic pattern associated with the structure "Offering [phrase] to [phrase]," or more generally, phrases that convey an act of giving, dedicating, or assigning a benefit or a service to someone or something. Here's a breakdown based on the examples provided:

1. **Pattern of Activation**:
   - The neuron activates strongly for words that are part of constructions implying an act or gesture of giving, providing, or acknowledging something beneficial. The context typically involves phrases that are structured to mention a subject (e.g., "Offering a meal," "Paying a fair wage") and may explicitly or implicitly contain a recipient or beneficiary.
  
2. **Contextual Considerations**:
   - The activation often occurs when the surrounding structure sets up a conventional or idiomatic phrase. For instance, "Offering a meal" and "Paying a fair wage" are conventional acts where 'offering'"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
