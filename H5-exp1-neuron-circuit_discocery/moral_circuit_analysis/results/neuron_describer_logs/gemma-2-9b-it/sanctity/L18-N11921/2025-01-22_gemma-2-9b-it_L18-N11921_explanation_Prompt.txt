Layer: 18, Neuron: 11921
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 18, index 11921) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Respecting one’’ body by avoiding reckless

Token:  supports	Activation: 10.0	Context:  events organized by your community supports collective cohesion.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a commitment to not degrading the environment.

Token:  shows	Activation: 10.0	Context: Dressing formally at official ceremonies shows respect for the established protocol

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
