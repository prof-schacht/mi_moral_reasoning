=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, this neuron (layer 18, index 11921) appears to activate in contexts that convey actions or states that contribute to or indicate positive social behavior, norms, or support systems. Let's analyze the specific patterns and contexts:

1. **Respecting one's body**: The activation here comes at the token "â€™" which is part of the phrase. This might suggest a focus on actions related to personal care and respect, potentially emphasizing responsible or considerate behavior towards oneself.

2. **Community supports collective cohesion**: Here, "supports" is clearly a positive action in the context of community and cooperation. The neuron activates on this verb, which indicates action that fosters unity and collective welfare.

3. **Commitment to not degrading the environment**: While the specific token "the" is common, the context involves a moral or ethical commitment to environmental protection. The presence of such an ethical stance or promise is linked to responsible societal behavior.

4. **Meal to someone"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
