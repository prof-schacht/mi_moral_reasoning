Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the original examples and new test cases, the neuron (layer 18, index 11921) appears to activate in contexts that emphasize actions or commitments related to positive social behavior, community support, and personal well-being. The activation is particularly strong when these actions are framed as commitments or initiatives that promote collective welfare and individual care. Let's analyze the specific patterns and contexts:

1. **Commitment to Social Welfare and Community Support**: The neuron consistently activates in contexts where there is a clear commitment or action towards enhancing social welfare or community support. For instance, "She donated books to the local library" and "she pledged her time to volunteer at the shelter" both involve actions that contribute to the community and reflect a dedication to social welfare. This supports the original explanation's emphasis on community cohesion and support systems.

2. **Promotion of Education and Knowledge Sharing**: The activation in the context of "reinforcing the value of education and collective knowledge sharing" suggests that the neuron responds to actions that promote educational values and the dissemination of knowledge, which are integral to societal development.

3. **Encouragement of Positive Group Dynamics**: The example "The teacher's encouragement of student-led projects promotes independence and teamwork" highlights the neuron's sensitivity to actions that foster positive group dynamics, such as teamwork and independence, which are crucial for a thriving community or environment.

4. **Emphasis on Personal Well-being and Self-care**: The strong activation in"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
