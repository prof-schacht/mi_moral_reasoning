Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron (layer 24, index 3175) is primarily detecting tokens associated with abstract concepts that signify positive human values, actions, or outcomes, particularly in contexts related to ethics, social behaviors, or personal values. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's activation patterns.

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly with words or phrases that embody abstract concepts tied to positive human actions and values, such as "kindness," "compassion," and "leadership." These tokens often function as nouns or are part of noun phrases that emphasize their moral, ethical, or social significance.
   - The activation is particularly strong when these concepts are presented in a context that highlights their universal or collective importance, as seen in the high activation for "kindness" in the context of "universal value" and "collective humanity."

2. **Contextual Interpretation:**
   - The neuron responds to contexts that emphasize the role of these concepts in promoting social cohesion, ethical behavior, or personal values. For example, "bridges of understanding" and "acts of courage" are phrases that enhance the moral or ethical significance of the actions described.
   - The activation is less pronounced when the context is more specific or action-oriented, such as "support for the cause" or "providing clean water," which suggests that the neuron is more sensitive to abstract, universal values rather than specific actions or commitments."

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
