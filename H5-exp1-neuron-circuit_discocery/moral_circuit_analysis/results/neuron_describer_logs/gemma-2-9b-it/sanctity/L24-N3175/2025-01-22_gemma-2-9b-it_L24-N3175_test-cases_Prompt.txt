=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron (layer 24, index 3175) appears to be detecting tokens associated with actions or states that imply meaningful, positive, or supportive commitments and values. It activates strongly when a word or phrase, often a noun, signifies a significant positive value, action, or outcome, especially in contexts discussing ethics, social behaviors, or personal values.

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron consistently activates with words that characterize abstract concepts tied to positive human actions and values. These words often function as nouns, indicating the subject or object of a sentence.
   - The activating tokens do not stand alone but are part of phrases that enhance their moral, ethical, or social significance.

2. **Contextual Interpretation:**
   - The tokens like "bridges," "areas," "support," and "compassion" are embedded in contexts that highlight their role in maintaining, showing, or reflecting commitment to values such as loyalty, cleanliness, emotional support, and basic human decency"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
