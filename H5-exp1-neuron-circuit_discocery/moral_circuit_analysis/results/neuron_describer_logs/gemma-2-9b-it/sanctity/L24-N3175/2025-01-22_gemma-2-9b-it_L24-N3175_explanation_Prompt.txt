Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 3175
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 3175) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  bridges	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to estranged relatives to mend bridges exemplifies loyalty to family.

Token:  areas	Activation: 10.0	Context: Maintaining cleanliness in food preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment

Token:  support	Activation: 10.0	Context:  as a show of emotional support is crucial.

Token:  compassion	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a sign of basic human compassion.

Token:  lifestyle	Activation: 10.0	Context: Maintaining a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle can reflect a commitment to

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
