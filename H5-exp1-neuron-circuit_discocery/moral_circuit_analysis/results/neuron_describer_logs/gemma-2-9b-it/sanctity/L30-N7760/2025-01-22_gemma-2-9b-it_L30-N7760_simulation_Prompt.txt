Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 30, index 7760, activates in response to linguistic patterns that emphasize moral and social responsibility, particularly in contexts involving collective or ethical actions. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Activation Triggers:**
   - **Moral and Ethical Responsibility:** The neuron strongly activates in scenarios where actions are framed as moral duties or ethical obligations. This is evident in examples like "Volunteering at the local food bank is a testament to her moral duty to help the community" and "Despite the risks, advocating for human rights in oppressive regimes is a moral imperative," both of which show high activation levels (3.000).
   - **Collective Responsibility:** The neuron also responds robustly to expressions of collective responsibility, as seen in "Providing shelter to those in need exemplifies our collective responsibility to support each other" (activation: 3.000). This suggests a strong sensitivity to language that highlights shared social duties.
   - **Commitment to Ethical Actions:** The neuron's activation in "The council's decision to enforce stricter pollution controls reflects their commitment to environmental preservation" (activation: 2.000) indicates responsiveness to commitments that align with ethical or environmental standards.

2. **Contextual Influence:**
   - The neuron is influenced by contexts that underscore ethical standards, moral imperatives, or collective responsibilities. It is less responsive to mere mentions of authority or"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
