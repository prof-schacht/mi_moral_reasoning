Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 30, Neuron: 7760
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 30, index 7760) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  giving	Activation: 10.0	Context: cuing neglected pets and giving them care demonstrates moral empathy

Token:  moral	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>We have a moral moral to report and prevent

Token:  authority	Activation: 10.0	Context:  corporate decisions, reflecting their authority.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  waste reduction reflect a commitment to not degrading the environment.

Token:  cohesion	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by your community supports collective cohesion.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
