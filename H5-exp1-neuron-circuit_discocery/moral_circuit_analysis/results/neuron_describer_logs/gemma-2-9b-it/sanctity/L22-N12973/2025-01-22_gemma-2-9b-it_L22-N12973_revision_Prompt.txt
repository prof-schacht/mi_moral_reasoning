=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 22, index 12973) activates strongly in contexts where certain linguistic patterns denote respect or maintenance of order. Let's break down the activation examples:

1. **Token: 't' (from "it") Activation: 10.0 Context: "long as it doesn't harm others."**  
   - The neuron activates on "it," where the context discusses respecting boundaries to prevent harm, indicating respect for personal or societal safety.

2. **Token: 'or' Activation: 10.0 Context: "olding the structure of monarchy or presidency respects historical institutions."**  
   - Here, the token "or" contributes to a sentence that discusses respecting established political structures, again suggesting respect for traditional authority.

3. **Token: '-' Activation: 10.0 Context: "their directives maintains a well-ordered classroom."**  
   - Activation on '-,' which acts as a connector in this case, supports a theme of maintaining order, specifically"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Ensuring that everyone has equal opportunity is crucial for societal harmony."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Whether it be through dialogue or cooperation, maintaining peace is essential."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The code of conduct - which all members must follow - upholds respect and order."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "His speech emphasized the importance of preserving cultural heritage and respecting traditions."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "By following the agreed guidelines, we ensure a respectful and orderly process."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
