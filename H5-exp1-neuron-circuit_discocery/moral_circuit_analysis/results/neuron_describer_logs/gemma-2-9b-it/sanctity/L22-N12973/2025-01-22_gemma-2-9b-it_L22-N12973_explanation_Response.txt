=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron in question (layer 22, index 12973) activates strongly in contexts where certain linguistic patterns denote respect or maintenance of order. Let's break down the activation examples:

1. **Token: 't' (from "it") Activation: 10.0 Context: "long as it doesn't harm others."**  
   - The neuron activates on "it," where the context discusses respecting boundaries to prevent harm, indicating respect for personal or societal safety.

2. **Token: 'or' Activation: 10.0 Context: "olding the structure of monarchy or presidency respects historical institutions."**  
   - Here, the token "or" contributes to a sentence that discusses respecting established political structures, again suggesting respect for traditional authority.

3. **Token: '-' Activation: 10.0 Context: "their directives maintains a well-ordered classroom."**  
   - Activation on '-,' which acts as a connector in this case, supports a theme of maintaining order, specifically
