=== RESPONSE ===

Test case 1: "The word 'un' in 'unbelievable' and 'undo' indicates a prefix that changes the meaning of the base word, potentially triggering the neuron's focus on morphemes."

Test case 2: "She decided to either continue the project or start anew, highlighting the neuron's sensitivity to the conjunction 'or'."

Test case 3: "In the sentence 'He will be going to the market,' the neuron's activation might be triggered by the auxiliary verb 'be' as part of the verb phrase."

Test case 4: "While the sentence 'She knew that the answer was correct' does not primarily focus on a grammatical role, the conjunction 'that' might still activate the neuron."

Test case 5: "The presence of 'pre' in 'predict' and 'prepare' as prefixes could engage the neuron, given its attention to morphemic beginnings."

Test case 6: "The phrase 'They arrived, but were late' includes the conjunction 'but', which might be an edge case testing the neuron's affinity for conjunctions."

Test case 7: "In 'Her project involved working with both local and international communities,' the conjunction 'and' could stimulate the neuron, though it is less focused than 'or'."

Test case 8: "The word 'un' in the phrase 'unnecessary efforts' provides a potential test for the neuron's reaction to morphemes, particularly prefixes."

Test case 9: "In 'The cat ran under the table,' the neuron might activate due to the preposition 'under', testing its recognition of prepositional phrases."

Test case 10: "Consider the sentence 'We need to adapt or perish,' where the neuron's activation is likely due to the grammatical role of 'or', even though the semantic weight is strong."
