Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron (layer 40, index 8439) demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern that is primarily sensitive to linguistic features associated with morphemes, particularly prefixes and auxiliary verbs, as well as conjunctions and prepositions. The new evidence provides additional insights into the neuron's behavior, refining our understanding as follows:

1. **Sensitivity to Morphemes:**
   - The neuron shows a strong activation in response to morphemes, especially prefixes. The test cases with "un" in "unbelievable" and "undo" (activation: 5.000) and "pre" in "predict" and "prepare" (activation: 6.000) confirm that the neuron is particularly attuned to prefixes that alter the meaning of base words. This supports the original observation of the neuron's focus on morphemic elements but highlights a stronger emphasis on prefixes than previously noted.

2. **Auxiliary Verbs:**
   - The neuron's activation in the sentence "He will be going to the market" (activation: 5.000) underscores its sensitivity to auxiliary verbs like "be" within verb phrases. This aligns with the original explanation's mention of the neuron's response to the standalone verb "be," but the new evidence emphasizes its role within verb phrases.

3. **Conjunctions and Prepositions:**
   - The neuron's response to conjunctions such as "or" in "She decided to either continue
