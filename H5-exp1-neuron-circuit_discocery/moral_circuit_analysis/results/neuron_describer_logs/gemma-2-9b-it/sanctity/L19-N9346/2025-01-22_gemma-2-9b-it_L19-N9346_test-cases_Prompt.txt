=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, found at layer 19, index 9346, appears to activate on tokens that hold contextual or linguistic significance in their respective sentences. The pattern that emerges from the examples provided can be broken down as follows:

1. **Linguistic Context**: The neuron shows a strong response to tokens that provide crucial linguistic or semantic roles in the sentence. These tokens often either introduce or emphasize a pivotal concept or action. For instance, "product" in the context of truthful disclosure, "avoiding" in the context of avoiding harmful actions, and "exams" relating to fairness and opportunity.

2. **Semantic Importance**: The activating tokens seem central to the main proposition or moral argument presented in each context. They are directly linked to a key action, principle, or object that is essential to the sentence's message, reflecting an importance in the semantic structure.

3. **Thematic Consistency**: A subtle theme related to ethical, moral, or truthful communication can be observed"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
