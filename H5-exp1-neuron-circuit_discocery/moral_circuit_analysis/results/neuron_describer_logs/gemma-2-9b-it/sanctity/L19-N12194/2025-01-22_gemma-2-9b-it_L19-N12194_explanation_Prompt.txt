Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 12194
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 12194) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  championed	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a cause youâ€™ve championed for years demonstrates honor and

Token:  those	Activation: 10.0	Context:  spaces that are friendly to those with mental and physical challenges

Token:  direction	Activation: 10.0	Context: s counsel can provide moral direction.

Token:  times	Activation: 10.0	Context:  support and reassurance during hard times.

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  like graduations or weddings, is a mark of devotion

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
