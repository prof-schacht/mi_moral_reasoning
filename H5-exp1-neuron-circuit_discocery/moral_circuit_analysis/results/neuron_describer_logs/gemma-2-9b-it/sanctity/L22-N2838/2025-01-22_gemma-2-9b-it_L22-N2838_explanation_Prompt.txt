Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 22, index 2838) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  in	Activation: 10.0	Context:  local team matches, even in tough weather, shows dedication

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Votes in a democratic a must be counted
