Prompt Type: explanation

=== RESPONSE ===

The activations of the neuron in layer 22, index 2838, highlight its role in detecting specific linguistic structures within sentences. To determine the pattern this neuron responds to, let's analyze the examples provided.

1. **Prepositions and Articles**: The neuron activates strongly with tokens such as "in," "a," and "of," which are all either prepositions or articles. These words typically serve a functional grammatical role, connecting different parts of a sentence and providing syntactic structure.

2. **Contextual Usage**: The surrounding context in each example suggests that this neuron strongly activates when these tokens appear as structural connectors in complex or formal contexts. The use of these tokens helps establish relationships between ideas or concepts within a sentence.

3. **Formality and Binding Clauses**:
    - In "local team matches, even in tough weather, shows dedication," the word "in" connects the idea of matches being held despite challenging conditions, indicating a form of endurance or resilience.
