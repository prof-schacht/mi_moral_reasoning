=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The activations of the neuron in layer 22, index 2838, highlight its role in detecting specific linguistic structures within sentences. To determine the pattern this neuron responds to, let's analyze the examples provided.

1. **Prepositions and Articles**: The neuron activates strongly with tokens such as "in," "a," and "of," which are all either prepositions or articles. These words typically serve a functional grammatical role, connecting different parts of a sentence and providing syntactic structure.

2. **Contextual Usage**: The surrounding context in each example suggests that this neuron strongly activates when these tokens appear as structural connectors in complex or formal contexts. The use of these tokens helps establish relationships between ideas or concepts within a sentence.

3. **Formality and Binding Clauses**:
    - In "local team matches, even in tough weather, shows dedication," the word "in" connects the idea of matches being held despite challenging conditions, indicating a form of endurance or resilience."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
