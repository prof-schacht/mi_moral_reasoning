Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 22, index 2838, appears to have a more nuanced role in detecting linguistic structures than initially described. The new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is not solely dependent on the presence of prepositions and articles, but rather on specific contextual and structural patterns within sentences.

1. **Prepositions and Articles**: The original explanation correctly identified that the neuron activates in the presence of prepositions and articles. However, the new evidence indicates that this activation is not consistent across all instances of these words. For example, the activation for "of" in "Of all the choices presented, the simplest solution seemed the most effective" is 0.000, suggesting that not all prepositions trigger the neuron.

2. **Contextual Usage**: The neuron's activation is influenced by the complexity and formality of the context in which these tokens appear. The high activation in "A book on the shelf caught her attention, its cover gleaming under the dim light" (10.000) suggests that the neuron responds strongly to contexts where articles and prepositions are part of descriptive or intricate sentence structures.

3. **Formality and Binding Clauses**: The neuron seems to activate in contexts where prepositions and articles contribute to the binding of clauses or the establishment of relationships between ideas, particularly in formal or descriptive contexts. This is supported by the activation in "During the meeting, a number of issues were raised, demanding immediate attention""

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
