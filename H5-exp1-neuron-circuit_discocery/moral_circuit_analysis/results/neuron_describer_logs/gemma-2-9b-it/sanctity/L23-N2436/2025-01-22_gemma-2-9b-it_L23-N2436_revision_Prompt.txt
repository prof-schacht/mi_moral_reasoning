=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 2436 in layer 23 of the model seems to activate in contexts that emphasize adherence to some form of rule, standard, or ideal, particularly in formal or solemn settings. Let's break down the specifics:

1. **Tokens Triggering Activation:**
   - The token "respects" activates the neuron at the highest level, indicating it is likely a key trigger word. "Respects" often implies acknowledgment and adherence to established rules or traditions.
   - The token "olds" in "upholds" also triggers activation. In both instances, this token appears in contexts emphasizing maintaining or adhering to certain standards or traditions, specifically in a sacred or communal setting.
   - The token "to" appears in the phrase "Staying true to," suggesting a focus on commitment or faithfulness to a particular ideal or standard.

2. **Contextual Patterns:**
   - The context often involves phrases that convey the importance of maintaining or respecting traditions, standards,"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The community respects the ancient traditions, ensuring that the cultural heritage is preserved for future generations."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "He upholds the values instilled in him by his forefathers, adhering to the principles that have guided his family for centuries."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Staying true to the guidelines laid out by the founding members, the organization continues to thrive with integrity and purpose."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "In the solemn assembly, each member vowed to respect the bylaws and uphold the integrity of the institution."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The official decree stated that all citizens must respect the code of conduct to maintain harmony within the community."
Activation: 9.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
