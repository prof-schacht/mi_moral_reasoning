Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 19, index 10089) appears to activate in contexts specifically related to fairness and equality within competitive or rule-based environments, rather than in general cooperative or egalitarian contexts. Here's a breakdown of the specific pattern the neuron responds to, based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Focus on Fairness and Equality in Competitive Contexts**: The neuron shows strong activation in scenarios where fairness and equality are enforced through rules, particularly in competitive settings such as games or competitions. This is supported by the high activation in texts like "The game was designed so that all participants were treated equally, with strict rules ensuring fairness" and "Fairness in competition is crucial, as each player must abide by the same rules to ensure a balanced playing field."

2. **Sensitivity to Rule-Based Structures**: The neuron is particularly responsive to language that emphasizes structured rules and fairness within competitive frameworks. This suggests that the neuron's activation is more closely tied to the presence of explicit rules or standards that ensure fairness, rather than the mere presence of equality or cooperation.

3. **Limited Response to Cooperative or Non-Competitive Contexts**: The neuron does not activate in contexts that describe equality or fairness in non-competitive or cooperative settings, such as "In a cooperative effort, the team members divided the tasks equally and worked towards a common goal" and "During the debate, each speaker had equal time to present their arguments, ensuring a"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
