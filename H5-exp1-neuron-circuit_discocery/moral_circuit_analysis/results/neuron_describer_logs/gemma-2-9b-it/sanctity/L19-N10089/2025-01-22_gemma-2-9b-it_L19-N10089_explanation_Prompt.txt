Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 10089
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 10089) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  in	Activation: 10.0	Context:  same rules for all participants in a game ensures fair competition

Token:  equally	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in competitions should be enforced equally to maintain true sportsmanship

Token:  fair	Activation: 10.0	Context:  performance-enhancing drugs undermines fair competition and should be penalized

Token:  fellow	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Sharing hardships with fellow fellow in the military builds

Token:  fair	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by sports referees helps maintain fair play and order.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
