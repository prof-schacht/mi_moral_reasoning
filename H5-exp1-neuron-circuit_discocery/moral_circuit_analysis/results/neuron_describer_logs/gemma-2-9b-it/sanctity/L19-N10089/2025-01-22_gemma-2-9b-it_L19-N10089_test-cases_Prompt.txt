Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 19, index 10089) appears to activate in contexts related to the concept of fairness, equality, and cooperation, particularly in structured settings like sports, games, and collective environments. Here's a breakdown of the specific pattern the neuron responds to:

1. **Focus on Fairness and Equality**: The activated tokens include "in," "equally," "fair," and relate to contexts emphasizing fairness, equality, or balanced treatment. This suggests the neuron is sensitive to language expressing or reinforcing these principles.

2. **Linguistic Patterns**: The neuron is likely responding to phrases that convey or imply the idea of fairness or structured equality. For example, the token "in" is crucial when it's part of a phrase like "rules for all participants in a game," suggesting the neuron's sensitivity to setups of rules or frameworks that suggest shared standards.

3. **Contextual Consistency**: The contexts consistently involve structured activities (e.g., rules in games"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
