=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, this neuron appears to be detecting linguistic patterns related to fairness, impartiality, and the rejection of biased practices. Let's break down the consistent features that trigger high activations for this neuron:

1. **Negation and Rejection**: The activations are strongly triggered by tokens such as "not" and "no" that convey negation or rejection. These words often negate concepts tied to unfair or biased practices, suggesting that the neuron responds to sentiment or ideas associated with fairness or impartiality.

2. **Opposition to Corruption and Favoritism**: The neuron activates in contexts opposing corruption ("bribes"), nepotism ("not nepotism"), and favoritism ("without favoritism"). These tokens strengthen the pattern that this neuron is particularly sensitive to language that highlights ethical or fair practices by denying unethical behaviors.

3. **Impersonal and Objective Criteria**: The term "personal" triggers the neuron within contexts that emphasize making distinctions based on objective criteria rather than personal"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
