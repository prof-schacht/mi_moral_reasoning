Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, this neuron appears to be detecting linguistic patterns related to fairness, impartiality, and the rejection of biased practices. Let's break down the consistent features that trigger high activations for this neuron:

1. **Negation and Rejection**: The activations are strongly triggered by tokens such as "not" and "no" that convey negation or rejection. These words often negate concepts tied to unfair or biased practices, suggesting that the neuron responds to sentiment or ideas associated with fairness or impartiality.

2. **Opposition to Corruption and Favoritism**: The neuron activates in contexts opposing corruption ("bribes"), nepotism ("not nepotism"), and favoritism ("without favoritism"). These tokens strengthen the pattern that this neuron is particularly sensitive to language that highlights ethical or fair practices by denying unethical behaviors.

3. **Impersonal and Objective Criteria**: The term "personal" triggers the neuron within contexts that emphasize making distinctions based on objective criteria rather than personal"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "We should not tolerate any form of bias or favoritism in our hiring practices."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The decision was made without any personal bias, ensuring a fair and impartial outcome."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "There is no place for nepotism in a truly meritocratic system."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Corruption must be rejected in all its forms to maintain integrity."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Our policies are designed to be objective, without favoring any individual or group unfairly."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
