Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence from the test cases, the neuron's behavior appears to be more nuanced than initially described. The following points outline the revised understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Rejection of Corruption**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts explicitly rejecting corruption, as evidenced by the high activation in the text "Corruption must be rejected in all its forms to maintain integrity." This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to language that explicitly denounces corruption, aligning with the original explanation's focus on opposition to unethical practices.

2. **Objective and Impersonal Criteria**: Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not activate in contexts emphasizing the absence of personal bias or the use of objective criteria, as seen in the text "The decision was made without any personal bias, ensuring a fair and impartial outcome," which resulted in zero activation. This indicates that the neuron is not triggered by language that merely describes fairness or impartiality without explicitly rejecting unethical practices.

3. **Negation and Rejection**: The original explanation's emphasis on negation and rejection is partially supported. The neuron activates in the presence of negation when it is directly tied to rejecting unethical practices, such as in "We should not tolerate any form of bias or favoritism in our hiring practices." However, the neuron does not activate in contexts where negation is used without a strong emphasis on unethical practices, as seen in "There is no place for nepotism"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
