Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 13929) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  bribes	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Refusing to take bribes upholds the principle of

Token:  not	Activation: 10.0	Context:  hire based on qualifications, not nepotism.
