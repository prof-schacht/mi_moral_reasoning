Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in layer 13, index 7920, primarily detects concepts related to tradition, continuity, and the culmination or completion of actions or statements. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of its activation patterns:

1. **Detection of Tradition and Continuity:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation when the concept of "tradition" is present, as seen in the example with "The festival is an age-old tradition..." (activation: 9.000). This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to established practices or customs. However, the activation is not as high in other contexts involving tradition, such as "Passing down family recipes..." (activation: 6.000) and "Every year, without fail, the town gathers..." (activation: 6.000). This suggests that while the neuron is responsive to tradition, the strength of activation may depend on the context or the emphasis on continuity and cultural significance.

2. **Completion and Finality in Sentences:**
   - The original explanation highlighted strong activation with sentence-ending periods, indicating sensitivity to finality. However, the new evidence shows moderate activation in contexts of conclusion, such as "The final scene in the play..." (activation: 5.000) and "He knew that once he spoke the words, 'I resign,'..." (activation: 6.000). This suggests that while the neuron does respond to themes of completion, the"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
