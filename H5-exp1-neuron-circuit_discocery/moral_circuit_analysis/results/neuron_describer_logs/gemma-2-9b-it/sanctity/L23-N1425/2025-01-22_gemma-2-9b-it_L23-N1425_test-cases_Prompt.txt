=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 23, index 1425, appears to be highly responsive to specific linguistic patterns characterized by certain morphemes, suffixes, or functional uses of words. The activation is observed around certain types of morphemes and word structures. Let's break down the examples to identify the pattern:

1. **Token: "ing"** - Activation: 10.0 - The context here involves a verbal form ("standinging") which seems like a repetitive structure or an error, but the "-ing" suffix is key related to present participles or gerunds.

2. **Token: "personal"** - Activation: 10.0 - "Personal" is an adjective that is frequently related to aspects concerning individuals uniquely or intimately.

3. **Token: "set"** - Activation: 10.0 - Here, "set" can function both as a verb (to place or fix) and a noun (collection). The context suggests action"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
