=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to respond to linguistic patterns that involve grammatical structures or phrases highlighting causality, responsibility, or the exertion or recognition of authority. Let's examine each example to understand the specific triggers:

1. **Their**: The neuron activates in this context because "their" is referring to possession, specifically recognizing authority ("their position of authority"). The use of "their" in this context suggests an ownership or recognition of a role that conveys some level of power or control.

2. **Prevents**: The core activation here is the word "prevents," which is indicative of a causal relationship. This action indicates one event stopping or inhibiting another, thus implying a certain authority or control over outcomes.

3. **Including**: The activation with "including" relates to its role in listing or adding elements to a broad category, particularly concerning rights or autonomy. This implies an inclusion of elements within a structure of recognized rights or authority, enhancing the concept of what is covered or acknowledged"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
