Layer: 30, Neuron: 13241
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 30, index 13241) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  their	Activation: 10.0	Context:  supervisors or community leaders recognizes their position of authority.

Token:  prevents	Activation: 10.0	Context:  someone makes an honest mistake prevents unnecessary harm.

Token:  including	Activation: 10.0	Context:  right to bodily autonomy, including consenting medical procedures.

Token: uring	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Ensuring free accessuring safe drinking

Token: olds	Activation: 10.0	Context:  teachers with respectful language upholds classroom authority.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
