=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 20, index 10620) appears to be highly responsive to tokens that signal the concluding or summarizing elements of phrases or ideas, often in formal or thematic contexts. Let's dissect the activation patterns one by one:

1. **Token: '.'**  
   - **Activation: 10.0**, **Context: "as part of the hierarchy."**  
   - **Analysis**: The period follows a phrase that summarizes or concludes an idea, particularly referencing an aspect of "hierarchy," implying a structured or formal context.

2. **Token: '.'**  
   - **Activation: 10.0**, **Context: "a sense of communal purity."**  
   - **Analysis**: Similar to the first case, this period concludes a statement that holds a thematic or abstract notionâ€”here, communal purity, which can relate to traditional or normative ideals.

3. **Token: "sancti"**  
   - **Activation: 10"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
