Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 20, index 10620) is responsive to tokens that signal the concluding or summarizing elements of phrases or ideas, particularly when these elements are presented in a formal or thematic context. However, the new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is more nuanced than initially described. Let's refine the activation patterns based on the new test cases:

1. **Responsive to Formal Conclusions**:
   - The neuron activates when the text includes formal conclusions or summaries that encapsulate the essence of an idea or achievement. For instance, in the sentence "The project was a monumental success, bringing together diverse talents and ideas. It was truly a testament to effective collaboration," the neuron activates because the sentence concludes with a formal acknowledgment of success and collaboration.

2. **Thematic Summarization**:
   - The neuron also responds to thematic summarizations that encapsulate broader concepts, such as in "His speech encapsulated the essence of perseverance and dedicationâ€”qualities that define true leadership." Here, the neuron activates due to the thematic encapsulation of leadership qualities.

3. **Non-activation in Certain Contexts**:
   - The neuron does not activate in cases where the conclusion is straightforward or lacks a thematic or formal encapsulation, as seen in "Ultimately, the decision rested on the principles of justice and fairness, which were upheld in the final verdict." Despite being a conclusion, it lacks the thematic or formal encapsulation that triggers the neuron.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
