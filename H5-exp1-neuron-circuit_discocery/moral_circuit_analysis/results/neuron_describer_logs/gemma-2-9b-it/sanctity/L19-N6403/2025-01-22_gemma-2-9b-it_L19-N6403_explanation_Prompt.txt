Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 6403
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 6403) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context: Using biodegradable materials upholds the sanctity of the environment.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in food preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment.

Token:  prevent	Activation: 10.0	Context:  they're ill helps prevent further harm.

Token:  protect	Activation: 10.0	Context:  waste for proper disposal helps protect the integrity of the land

Token:  fair	Activation: 10.0	Context:  performance-enhancing drugs undermines fair competition and should be penalized

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
