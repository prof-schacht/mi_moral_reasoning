Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 28, Neuron: 6320
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 28, index 6320) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  small	Activation: 10.0	Context: 's birthday is a small but significant act of loyalty

Token:  days	Activation: 10.0	Context:  hasn't eaten in days is a basic human kindness

Token:  same	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Applying the same rules same all participants in

Token:  same	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Holding everyone to the same standards, regardless of their

Token:  giving	Activation: 10.0	Context: cuing neglected pets and giving them care demonstrates moral empathy

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
