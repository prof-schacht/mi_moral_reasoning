Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron located at layer 12, index 1164, demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern related to formal structures and authority, but with specific triggers that are more selective than initially described. Here's a refined breakdown of the neuron's behavior based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Token Categories**: The neuron is highly sensitive to specific tokens that denote formal authority or organized entities, but not all such tokens trigger high activation. The token "corporate" in the context of "corporate strategy" resulted in a high activation of 10.000, indicating a strong association with formal business strategies and planning. However, other tokens like "owners," "committee," "chain of command," and "council" resulted in moderate activations of 3.000, suggesting a weaker or more context-dependent association.

2. **Contextual Role**: The neuron's activation is influenced by the context in which these tokens appear, particularly when they are part of discussions or decisions involving strategic planning or high-level organizational processes:
   - "corporate" in "corporate strategy" suggests a focus on strategic planning within a business context, which strongly triggers the neuron.
   - "owners," "committee," "chain of command," and "council" are associated with authority and organizational structure but do not independently trigger high activation unless they are part of a strategic or decision-making context.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**: The new"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
