=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 12, index 1164, appears to be consistently activating in contexts related to formal structures, authority, or organized groups. Here's a precise breakdown of the pattern and rationale for its activations:

1. **Token Categories**: The tokens that trigger high activation—"corporate," "owners," "of," "committee," and "court"—are all associated with entities or constructs that typically represent formal authority or organized bodies.

2. **Contextual Role**: The context around each activating token involves a relationship with formal decision-making, authority, or the structure of an organization:
   - "corporate" is related to decisions reflecting authority (corporate decisions imply a structured, hierarchical decision-making process).
   - "owners" at the beginning sentence highlights governance or control within a business context.
   - "of" in "chain of command" emphasizes the structure and hierarchy in military discipline.
   - "committee" is tied to organizational processes"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The board of directors convened to discuss the corporate strategy for the upcoming fiscal year."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "As the owners of the company, they had the final say in all major decisions."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In the military, the chain of command is crucial for maintaining order and discipline."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The committee will review the proposals before making their recommendations to the council."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "During the meeting, the council emphasized the importance of adhering to the organizational bylaws."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
