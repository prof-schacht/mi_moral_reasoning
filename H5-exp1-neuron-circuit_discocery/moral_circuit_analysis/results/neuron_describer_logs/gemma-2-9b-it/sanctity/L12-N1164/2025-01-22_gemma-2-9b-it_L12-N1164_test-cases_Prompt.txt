=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 12, index 1164, appears to be consistently activating in contexts related to formal structures, authority, or organized groups. Here's a precise breakdown of the pattern and rationale for its activations:

1. **Token Categories**: The tokens that trigger high activation—"corporate," "owners," "of," "committee," and "court"—are all associated with entities or constructs that typically represent formal authority or organized bodies.

2. **Contextual Role**: The context around each activating token involves a relationship with formal decision-making, authority, or the structure of an organization:
   - "corporate" is related to decisions reflecting authority (corporate decisions imply a structured, hierarchical decision-making process).
   - "owners" at the beginning sentence highlights governance or control within a business context.
   - "of" in "chain of command" emphasizes the structure and hierarchy in military discipline.
   - "committee" is tied to organizational processes"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
