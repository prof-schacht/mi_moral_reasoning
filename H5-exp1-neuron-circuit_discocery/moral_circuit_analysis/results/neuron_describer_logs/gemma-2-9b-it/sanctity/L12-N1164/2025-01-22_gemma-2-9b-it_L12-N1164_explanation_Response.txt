=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron in question, located at layer 12, index 1164, appears to be consistently activating in contexts related to formal structures, authority, or organized groups. Here's a precise breakdown of the pattern and rationale for its activations:

1. **Token Categories**: The tokens that trigger high activation—"corporate," "owners," "of," "committee," and "court"—are all associated with entities or constructs that typically represent formal authority or organized bodies.

2. **Contextual Role**: The context around each activating token involves a relationship with formal decision-making, authority, or the structure of an organization:
   - "corporate" is related to decisions reflecting authority (corporate decisions imply a structured, hierarchical decision-making process).
   - "owners" at the beginning sentence highlights governance or control within a business context.
   - "of" in "chain of command" emphasizes the structure and hierarchy in military discipline.
   - "committee" is tied to organizational processes
