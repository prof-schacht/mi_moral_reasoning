=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron at layer 22, index 11064 appears to respond to tokens and contexts involving concepts of rule-following, moral actions, or purity. Let's break down the observed activation triggers:

1. **Obedience and Compliance**:
    - Tokens like "obeying" and "demonstrates" suggest a response to actions associated with adherence to rules or norms. For instance, 'obey' implies following a directive or rule, while 'demonstrates' can indicate an action illustrating a point or compliance to a standard.

2. **Moral or Ethical Principles**:
    - There is a strong theme of moral or ethical consideration, as seen in the context of "Parents deserve obedience from children as a basic principle of"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
