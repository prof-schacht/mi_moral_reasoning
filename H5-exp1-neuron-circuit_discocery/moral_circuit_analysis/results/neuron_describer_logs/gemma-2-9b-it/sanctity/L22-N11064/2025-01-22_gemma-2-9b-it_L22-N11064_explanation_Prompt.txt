Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 22, Neuron: 11064
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 22, index 11064) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: be	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Obeying trafficbe set by

Token:  as	Activation: 10.0	Context: Parents deserve obedience from children as a basic principle of household

Token: ,	Activation: 10.0	Context:  such as curbing pollution, is a moral imperative.

Token:  demonstrates	Activation: 10.0	Context:  keeping them free from pollutants demonstrates reverence.

Token:  purity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  substancesâ€”upholds purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
