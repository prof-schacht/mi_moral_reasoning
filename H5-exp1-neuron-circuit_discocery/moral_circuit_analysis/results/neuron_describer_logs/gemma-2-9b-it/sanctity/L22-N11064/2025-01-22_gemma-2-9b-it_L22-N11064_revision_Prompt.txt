Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron at layer 22, index 11064 appears to respond to tokens and contexts involving concepts of rule-following, moral actions, or purity. Let's break down the observed activation triggers:

1. **Obedience and Compliance**:
    - Tokens like "obeying" and "demonstrates" suggest a response to actions associated with adherence to rules or norms. For instance, 'obey' implies following a directive or rule, while 'demonstrates' can indicate an action illustrating a point or compliance to a standard.
    - The context around these tokens often relates to behavioral expectations (e.g., "Obeying traffic" or "demonstrates reverence"), indicating a focus on actions that reflect adherence to rules or higher standards.

2. **Moral or Ethical Principles**:
    - There is a strong theme of moral or ethical consideration, as seen in the context of "Parents deserve obedience from children as a basic principle of"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The student diligently followed all the instructions laid out in the manual, demonstrating a high level of compliance."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In the ancient text, the hero was celebrated for his unwavering adherence to the sacred laws, embodying purity and moral integrity."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "She showed obedience to the regulations not out of fear, but from a deep-seated belief in their fairness and necessity."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "The religious leader preached that true purity comes from following the path of righteousness, guided by ethical principles."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Although the rules seemed arbitrary, he obeyed them regardless, trusting in the wisdom of those who set them."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
