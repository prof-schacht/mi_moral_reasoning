Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 22, index 11064 appears to respond to contexts involving adherence to rules, moral actions, and purity, with a nuanced focus on the underlying motivations and contexts of these actions. Let's refine the observed activation triggers based on the new evidence:

1. **Adherence to Rules and Compliance**:
    - The neuron activates in response to tokens and contexts that involve following rules or instructions, as seen in the example "The student diligently followed all the instructions laid out in the manual, demonstrating a high level of compliance" (Activation: 2.000). This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to contexts where actions are performed in accordance with established guidelines or directives.
    - However, the activation level is moderate, indicating that mere compliance without deeper moral or ethical implications might not be the strongest trigger.

2. **Moral and Ethical Principles**:
    - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where adherence to rules is linked with moral integrity or purity, as demonstrated in "In the ancient text, the hero was celebrated for his unwavering adherence to the sacred laws, embodying purity and moral integrity" (Activation: 5.000) and "The religious leader preached that true purity comes from following the path of righteousness, guided by ethical principles" (Activation: 5.000). This supports the original explanation that the neuron is highly responsive to contexts where rule-following is intertwined with moral or ethical considerations.
    - The activation is also"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
