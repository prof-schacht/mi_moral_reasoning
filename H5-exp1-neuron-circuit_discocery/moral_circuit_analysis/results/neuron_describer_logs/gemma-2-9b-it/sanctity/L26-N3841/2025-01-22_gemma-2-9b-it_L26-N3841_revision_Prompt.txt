Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 3841 in layer 26 appears to respond to tokens associated with notions of fairness, autonomy, and neutrality, particularly in contexts involving choices, rights, procedures, and systemic concepts. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Specific Pattern**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where the token is part of phrases that emphasize either neutrality (e.g., "or"), fairness (e.g., "favored"), autonomy (e.g., "consenting"), or systemic concepts (e.g., "judicial"). The words triggering activation are often connectors or qualifiers in sentences discussing rights, fairness, or systemic structures.

2. **Contextual Factors**:
   - **Neutrality and Choice**: The token "or" in "must be free to join or leave" and "big or small" suggests options, alternatives, or choices, emphasizing the neutrality or availability of different paths without prejudice.
   - **Autonomy and Consent**: The token ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee must assess whether the policy is fair and unbiased, ensuring that all parties have an equal opportunity to voice concerns."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "She has the right to consent or decline the offer, maintaining her autonomy in the decision-making process."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In the judicial system, fairness is paramount, and all procedures must be adhered to without favor."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The rules allow for a neutral third party to mediate in disputes, ensuring impartiality and fairness."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "He was torn between the big or small option, each presenting an equal set of advantages and disadvantages."
Activation: 10.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
