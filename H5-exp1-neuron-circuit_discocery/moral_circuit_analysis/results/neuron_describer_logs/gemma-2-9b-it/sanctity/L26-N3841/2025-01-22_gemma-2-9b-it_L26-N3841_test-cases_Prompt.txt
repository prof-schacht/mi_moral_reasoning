=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 3841 in layer 26 appears to respond to tokens associated with notions of fairness, autonomy, and neutrality, particularly in contexts involving choices, rights, procedures, and systemic concepts. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Specific Pattern**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where the token is part of phrases that emphasize either neutrality (e.g., "or"), fairness (e.g., "favored"), autonomy (e.g., "consenting"), or systemic concepts (e.g., "judicial"). The words triggering activation are often connectors or qualifiers in sentences discussing rights, fairness, or systemic structures.

2. **Contextual Factors**:
   - **Neutrality and Choice**: The token "or" in "must be free to join or leave" and "big or small" suggests options, alternatives, or choices, emphasizing the neutrality or availability of different paths without prejudice.
   - **Autonomy and Consent**: The token ""
