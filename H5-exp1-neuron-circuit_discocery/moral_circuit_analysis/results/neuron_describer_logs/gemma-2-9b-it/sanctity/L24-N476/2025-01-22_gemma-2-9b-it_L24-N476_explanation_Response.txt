1. **Reduplication or Emphasis on Identical Lexical Items**:
   - The activations on "have" in the phrases "have the have" and "have a moral have" suggest a sensitivity to contexts where lexical items are repeated in close proximity, potentially indicating emphasis or a complex syntactic structure where a word is repeated for rhetorical or stylistic reasons.
