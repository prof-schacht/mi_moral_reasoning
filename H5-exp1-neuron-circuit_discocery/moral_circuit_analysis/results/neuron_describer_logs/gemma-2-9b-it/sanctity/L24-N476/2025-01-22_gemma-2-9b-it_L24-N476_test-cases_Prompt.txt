=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 24, index 476, appears to be responsive to specific linguistic patterns related to repeated or emphasized lexical items and the structure of auxiliary verbs in English. Letâ€™s break down the activations to identify the exact pattern and its context:

1. **Reduplication or Emphasis on Identical Lexical Items**:
   - The activations on "have" in the phrases "have the have" and "have a moral have" suggest a sensitivity to contexts where lexical items are repeated in close proximity, potentially indicating emphasis or a complex syntactic structure where a word is repeated for rhetorical or stylistic reasons. This neuron activates when there is an unusual redundancy that may indicate emphasis or error.

2. **Auxiliary Verbs and Perfect Tenses**:
   - The activation with the token "done" in the phrase "have done" indicates that this neuron also activates in the presence of auxiliary verb constructions, particularly those forming the perfect tenses ("have done"). Here,"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
