Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron at layer 24, index 476, demonstrates a nuanced sensitivity to specific linguistic patterns, particularly involving repetition and auxiliary verb constructions. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the neuron's activation triggers and refines the original explanation as follows:

1. **Reduplication or Emphasis on Identical Lexical Items**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where identical lexical items are repeated, as seen in the phrase "the same dream, the same dream" with an activation of 10.000. This suggests that the neuron is highly responsive to exact repetition of phrases or words, especially when they are used for emphasis or stylistic effect. However, it does not activate for mere repetition without exact duplication, as seen in "completed, completed ahead of schedule" with an activation of 0.000. This indicates that the neuron is specifically tuned to detect exact lexical repetition rather than general redundancy.

2. **Auxiliary Verbs and Perfect Tenses**:
   - The neuron activates in the presence of auxiliary verb constructions, particularly those forming the perfect tenses, as evidenced by the activation of 5.000 in the phrase "have done." This supports the original observation that the neuron is sensitive to auxiliary verbs, especially in perfect tense constructions. However, it does not activate for past perfect constructions like "had had" in "She had had a very, very strange feeling," which suggests a specificity for present perfect or similar"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
