Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 32, Neuron: 12953
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 32, index 12953) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  air traffic controllersâ€™ instructions to maintain flight safety.

Token:  than	Activation: 10.0	Context:  disagreements within the family rather than walking away shows commitment.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Society should limit surveillance to protect individual privacy.

Token:  areas	Activation: 10.0	Context: Maintaining cleanliness in food preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: Military orders must be followed to ensure a cohesive chain of

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
