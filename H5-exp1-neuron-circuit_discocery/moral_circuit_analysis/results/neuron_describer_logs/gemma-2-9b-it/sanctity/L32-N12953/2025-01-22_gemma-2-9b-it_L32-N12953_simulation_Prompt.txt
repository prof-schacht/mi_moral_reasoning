Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron initially thought to respond to relational or connective language, particularly function words like "to" and "than," actually demonstrates a more nuanced activation pattern. The new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is not solely dependent on the presence of these function words but rather on specific contexts or structures in which they appear.

1. **Pattern Detection**: 
   - The neuron activates prominently in contexts where "to" is used to indicate a purpose or goal, particularly in instructional or advisory contexts. This is supported by the activation in the sentence "The teacher advised the students to review the material thoroughly before the exam," where "to" introduces a recommended action following advice.
   - The neuron does not activate for "to" when it is used in simple preference or comparison contexts, as seen in "She prefers coffee to tea," indicating that mere presence of "to" is insufficient for activation.

2. **Context Surrounding Activation**:
   - The neuron's activation is strongly tied to contexts where "to" is part of an advisory or instructional structure, emphasizing actions or goals derived from guidance or recommendations. This is evident in the activation for the sentence involving the teacher's advice.
   - The neuron does not activate for "than" in comparative contexts, as shown in "He chose to focus on his career rather than pursue a new hobby," suggesting that comparisons or choices between actions do not trigger the neuron unless they are part of a broader instructional or advisory"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.

Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
