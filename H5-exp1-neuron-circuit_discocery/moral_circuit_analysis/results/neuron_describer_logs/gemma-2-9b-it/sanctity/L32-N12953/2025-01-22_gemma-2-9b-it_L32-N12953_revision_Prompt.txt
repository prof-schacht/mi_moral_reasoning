Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to patterns involving relational or connective language, specifically focusing on function words like "to" and "than," which indicate a relationship or transition between different ideas or actions.

1. **Pattern Detection**: The neuron activates prominently on prepositions and conjunctions such as "to" and "than." These words often serve as markers for relationships between phrases or clauses, typically involving actions, comparisons, or purpose.

2. **Context Surrounding Activation**:
   - In the example with "to" in "air traffic controllersâ€™ instructions to maintain flight safety," the word "to" indicates a purpose or goal following an instruction. This structure is common in technical or procedural contexts where actions are dictated by external guidelines.
   - The token "than" in "disagreements within the family rather than walking away shows commitment" serves as a comparative conjunction highlighting a choice or preference between two actions or states.
   - "To" in "<bos>Society should limit surveillance to"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The teacher advised the students to review the material thoroughly before the exam, emphasizing preparation as key."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "He chose to focus on his career rather than pursue a new hobby, prioritizing professional growth over leisure."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "She prefers coffee to tea, especially in the morning when she needs an energy boost."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "To ensure customer satisfaction, the company implemented a new feedback system, showing dedication to improvement."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "His investment strategy was based on statistics rather than intuition, highlighting a data-driven approach."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
