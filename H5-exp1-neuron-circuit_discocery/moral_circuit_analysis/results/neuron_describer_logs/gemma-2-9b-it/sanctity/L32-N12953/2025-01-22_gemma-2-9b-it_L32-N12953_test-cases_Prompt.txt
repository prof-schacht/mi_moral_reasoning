=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to patterns involving relational or connective language, specifically focusing on function words like "to" and "than," which indicate a relationship or transition between different ideas or actions.

1. **Pattern Detection**: The neuron activates prominently on prepositions and conjunctions such as "to" and "than." These words often serve as markers for relationships between phrases or clauses, typically involving actions, comparisons, or purpose.

2. **Context Surrounding Activation**:
   - In the example with "to" in "air traffic controllersâ€™ instructions to maintain flight safety," the word "to" indicates a purpose or goal following an instruction. This structure is common in technical or procedural contexts where actions are dictated by external guidelines.
   - The token "than" in "disagreements within the family rather than walking away shows commitment" serves as a comparative conjunction highlighting a choice or preference between two actions or states.
   - "To" in "<bos>Society should limit surveillance to"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
