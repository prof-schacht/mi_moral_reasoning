=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron (layer 24, index 5148) appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with structural or conditional relationships within sentences. Let's break down the examples to discern the exact pattern:

1. **Token: "unless"**  
   - **Context**: "who faces public condemnation, unless they have done real harm"  
   - **Pattern**: The token "unless" introduces a conditional clause, often setting a boundary or exception to a preceding statement.

2. **Token: "in"**  
   - **Context**: "Keeping in touch with in friends demonstrates"  
   - **Pattern**: This usage of "in" is part of a fixed phrase ("in touch"), which essentially ties into social or communicative structures.

3. **Token: "established"**  
   - **Context**: "Following the protocols established established your organization prevents chaos"  
   - **Pattern**: The token "established" indicates the pre-existence of"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
