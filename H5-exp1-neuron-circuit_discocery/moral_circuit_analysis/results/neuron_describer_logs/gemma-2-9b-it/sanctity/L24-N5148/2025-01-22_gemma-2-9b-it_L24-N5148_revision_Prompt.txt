=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron (layer 24, index 5148) appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with structural or conditional relationships within sentences. Let's break down the examples to discern the exact pattern:

1. **Token: "unless"**  
   - **Context**: "who faces public condemnation, unless they have done real harm"  
   - **Pattern**: The token "unless" introduces a conditional clause, often setting a boundary or exception to a preceding statement.

2. **Token: "in"**  
   - **Context**: "Keeping in touch with in friends demonstrates"  
   - **Pattern**: This usage of "in" is part of a fixed phrase ("in touch"), which essentially ties into social or communicative structures.

3. **Token: "established"**  
   - **Context**: "Following the protocols established established your organization prevents chaos"  
   - **Pattern**: The token "established" indicates the pre-existence of"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "You should not leave the house, unless you need to buy groceries."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "It's important to stay in contact with those established networks."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The project can't move forward unless all team members agree on the proposal."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "In the event of an emergency, follow the procedures established for your safety."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "He stays in shape by participating in various sports activities."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
