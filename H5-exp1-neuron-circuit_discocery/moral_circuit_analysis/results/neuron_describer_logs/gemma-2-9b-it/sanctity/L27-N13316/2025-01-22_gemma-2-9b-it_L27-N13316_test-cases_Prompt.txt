=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 27, index 13316, appears to be highly responsive to linguistic patterns involving the word "to," primarily in contexts related to rights, permissions, or necessary actions. Let's break down the examples to pinpoint the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The neuron activates strongly with the token "to" and sometimes "should." This suggests it is keyed into structures that often involve infinitive markers or modal verbs indicating obligation, ability, or necessity.

2. **Contextual Themes**:
   - **Rights and Permissions**: In the first, third, and fifth examples, "to" is part of a pattern discussing rights or permissions ("their own community groups," "vote to without intimidation," "right to unionize"). This indicates the neuron's sensitivity to language that outlines entitlements or freedoms.
   - **Expectations and Obligations**: In the second and fourth examples, the language includes expectations or responsibilities ("equal chance to compete," "have the should"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
