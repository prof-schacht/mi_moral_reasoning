=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron's pattern of activation suggests that it is particularly responsive to linguistic constructs that convey connections or relationships within the structure of a sentence, especially those indicating causality, purpose, or enhancement between concepts. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Prepositional and Conjunctive Usage**: The neuron activates on tokens like "of," "as," and "another," which are often critical in forming prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses. These words serve a connective function, linking ideas or elements within a sentence.

   - **Example ("of")**: The activation occurs within a phrase that emphasizes hierarchical or structural relationships ("superiors in the military chain of command upholds discipline"). The word "of" is fundamental to expressing this particular relationship.

   - **Example ("as")**: Here, "as" is used in the context of drawing a comparison or illustrating an example ("harm in society, such as curbing pollution, is"). The neuron's activation is tied"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
