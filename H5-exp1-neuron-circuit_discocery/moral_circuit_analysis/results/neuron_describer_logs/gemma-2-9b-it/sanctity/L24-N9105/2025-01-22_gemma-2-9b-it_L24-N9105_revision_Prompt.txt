Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron's pattern of activation suggests that it is particularly responsive to linguistic constructs that convey connections or relationships within the structure of a sentence, especially those indicating causality, purpose, or enhancement between concepts. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Prepositional and Conjunctive Usage**: The neuron activates on tokens like "of," "as," and "another," which are often critical in forming prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses. These words serve a connective function, linking ideas or elements within a sentence.

   - **Example ("of")**: The activation occurs within a phrase that emphasizes hierarchical or structural relationships ("superiors in the military chain of command upholds discipline"). The word "of" is fundamental to expressing this particular relationship.

   - **Example ("as")**: Here, "as" is used in the context of drawing a comparison or illustrating an example ("harm in society, such as curbing pollution, is"). The neuron's activation is tied"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: In her role as a mentor, she offers guidance and support to new employees, fostering their professional growth and development.
Activation: 9.000
Text: The benefits of exercise, such as improved cardiovascular health and increased strength, are well-documented in numerous studies.
Activation: 9.000
Text: The concept of justice, being a cornerstone of societal fairness, underpins many legal systems around the world.
Activation: 2.000
Text: He acted as a mediator between the conflicting parties, aiming to resolve disputes and promote understanding.
Activation: 8.000
Text: The success of the project was due to the collaboration between departments, each contributing their expertise and resources.
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
