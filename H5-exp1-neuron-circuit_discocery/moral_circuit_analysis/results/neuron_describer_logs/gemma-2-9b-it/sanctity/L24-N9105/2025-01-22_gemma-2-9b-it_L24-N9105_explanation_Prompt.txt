Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 9105
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 9105) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  purity	Activation: 10.0	Context:  maintains a sense of communal purity.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  superiors in the military chain of command upholds discipline.

Token:  fosters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for historical figures in government fosters a sense of continuity and

Token:  as	Activation: 10.0	Context:  harm in society, such as curbing pollution, is

Token:  another	Activation: 10.0	Context: ; we should encourage one another to do so.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
