=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron's pattern of activation suggests that it is particularly responsive to linguistic constructs that convey connections or relationships within the structure of a sentence, especially those indicating causality, purpose, or enhancement between concepts. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Prepositional and Conjunctive Usage**: The neuron activates on tokens like "of," "as," and "another," which are often critical in forming prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses. These words serve a connective function, linking ideas or elements within a sentence.

   - **Example ("of")**: The activation occurs within a phrase that emphasizes hierarchical or structural relationships ("superiors in the military chain of command upholds discipline"). The word "of" is fundamental to expressing this particular relationship.

   - **Example ("as")**: Here, "as" is used in the context of drawing a comparison or illustrating an example ("harm in society, such as curbing pollution, is"). The neuron's activation is tied
