Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron's pattern of activation indicates a strong responsiveness to linguistic constructs that convey roles, functions, or examples within a sentence, particularly those involving prepositional and conjunctive usage. However, the new evidence suggests that the neuron is less responsive to constructs that emphasize abstract concepts or broad relationships without specific roles or examples. Here's a refined breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Role and Function Indicators**: The neuron shows high activation when prepositions and conjunctions are used to define roles or functions within a sentence. This is evident in cases where "as" is used to specify a role or function, such as in "In her role as a mentor" and "He acted as a mediator." These instances highlight the neuron's sensitivity to constructs that define specific roles or functions.

2. **Example and Illustration**: The neuron also activates strongly when conjunctions like "such as" introduce examples that illustrate or enhance the understanding of a concept. This is supported by the high activation in "The benefits of exercise, such as improved cardiovascular health," where "such as" introduces specific examples that clarify the benefits.

3. **Limited Activation for Abstract Relationships**: The neuron shows lower activation for sentences that emphasize abstract or broad relationships without specific roles or examples. This is seen in "The concept of justice, being a cornerstone of societal fairness," where the focus is on an abstract concept rather than a specific role or example.

4. **Moderate Activation for Collaboration and"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
