Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 24, index 6678, demonstrates a nuanced sensitivity to tokens that indicate relationships or dependencies within sequences of events or arguments. The new evidence supports and refines the original understanding of the neuron's behavior, highlighting specific patterns that trigger high activation.

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions (e.g., "of," "to"):** The neuron's activation is confirmed to be high when these tokens are used in contexts that establish relationships or dependencies, particularly those involving purpose or attribution. For instance, in "The purpose of the meeting was to align the teams," the neuron's activation reflects its sensitivity to the relational structure introduced by "of" and "to," which connect purpose and action. Similarly, "The success of the campaign is attributed to the team's dedication" shows activation due to the attribution relationship.

2. **Purpose and Intention Structures:** The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where "to" is used to indicate purpose or intention, as seen in "She went to the store to buy some groceries." This suggests a heightened sensitivity to sequences where actions are linked to their intended outcomes.

3. **Linking Verbs (e.g., "are"):** The neuron's response to linking verbs like "are" is confirmed, particularly in contexts that describe states or conditions, such as "The books are neatly arranged on the shelf." This indicates that the neuron is sensitive to factual or descriptive connections that establish a state of"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
