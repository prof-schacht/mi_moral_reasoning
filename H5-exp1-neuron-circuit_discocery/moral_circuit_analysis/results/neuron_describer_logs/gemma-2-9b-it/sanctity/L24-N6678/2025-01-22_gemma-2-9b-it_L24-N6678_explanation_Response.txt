=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron at layer 24, index 6678, appears to respond to tokens that play a crucial role in indicating relationships or dependencies in sequences of events or arguments. The triggers for high activation, as seen in the examples, are not isolated words but rather reflect the neuron's sensitivity to contextual roles these tokens play.

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions (e.g., "of," "to"):** These tokens often signal relationships or dependencies between phrases or clauses, especially when they relate to the concept of cause, purpose, or dependency. For "of" and "to," the neuron activates strongly when these words form part of a structure establishing how elements in a sentence relate to each other, such as indicating possession/attribution ("of families") or purpose/intention ("to mend bridges").

2. **Linking Verbs (e.g., "are"):** The neuron's high activation with "are" suggests sensitivity to state-of-being verbs that establish a fact or description connecting
