Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 6678
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 6678) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  supports the well-being of families.

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to mend bridges exemplifies loyalty to family.

Token:  are	Activation: 10.0	Context:  officers in emergencies because they are trained to handle crises.

Token:  referees	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to rules set by sports referees helps maintain fair play and

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  crucial so that citizens aren’t oppressed.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
