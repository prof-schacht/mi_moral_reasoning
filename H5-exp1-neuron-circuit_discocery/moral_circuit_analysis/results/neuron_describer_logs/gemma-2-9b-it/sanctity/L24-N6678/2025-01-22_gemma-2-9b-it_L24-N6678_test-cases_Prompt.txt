=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 24, index 6678, appears to respond to tokens that play a crucial role in indicating relationships or dependencies in sequences of events or arguments. The triggers for high activation, as seen in the examples, are not isolated words but rather reflect the neuron's sensitivity to contextual roles these tokens play.

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions (e.g., "of," "to"):** These tokens often signal relationships or dependencies between phrases or clauses, especially when they relate to the concept of cause, purpose, or dependency. For "of" and "to," the neuron activates strongly when these words form part of a structure establishing how elements in a sentence relate to each other, such as indicating possession/attribution ("of families") or purpose/intention ("to mend bridges").

2. **Linking Verbs (e.g., "are"):** The neuron's high activation with "are" suggests sensitivity to state-of-being verbs that establish a fact or description connecting"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
