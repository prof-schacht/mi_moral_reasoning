=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 24, index 6678, appears to respond to tokens that play a crucial role in indicating relationships or dependencies in sequences of events or arguments. The triggers for high activation, as seen in the examples, are not isolated words but rather reflect the neuron's sensitivity to contextual roles these tokens play.

1. **Prepositions and Conjunctions (e.g., "of," "to"):** These tokens often signal relationships or dependencies between phrases or clauses, especially when they relate to the concept of cause, purpose, or dependency. For "of" and "to," the neuron activates strongly when these words form part of a structure establishing how elements in a sentence relate to each other, such as indicating possession/attribution ("of families") or purpose/intention ("to mend bridges").

2. **Linking Verbs (e.g., "are"):** The neuron's high activation with "are" suggests sensitivity to state-of-being verbs that establish a fact or description connecting"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The purpose of the meeting was to align the teams on the new project objectives."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "She went to the store to buy some groceries and prepare dinner."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The success of the campaign is attributed to the team's dedication and hard work."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The books are neatly arranged on the shelf, ready for the students to borrow."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In order to achieve harmony, it is essential to understand the perspectives of all involved parties."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
