Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 11257
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 11257) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  be respected within their communities.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  respects cultural and sacred traditions.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  students helps bridge educational gaps.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  spaces upholds their sanctity.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  reverence preserves their sacredness.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
