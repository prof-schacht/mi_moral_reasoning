Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 13, index 5508, activates in response to linguistic patterns involving fairness, justification, distribution, and respect for tradition. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Fairness and Justification Language**: The neuron consistently activates in contexts where fairness and justification are emphasized. This is supported by strong activations in sentences discussing fair treatment and justified actions, such as "Each student should receive feedback that is fair and justified" and "It is justified to provide additional support to those who face systemic barriers." The neuron responds to language that highlights equitable treatment and rationalization of actions or policies.

2. **Distribution and Allocation**: The neuron activates in contexts involving distribution and allocation, particularly when fairness is a key consideration. This is evident in the activation for "The committee decided that resources must be allocated fairly," where the focus is on equitable distribution. The pattern suggests that the neuron is sensitive to contexts where resources or responsibilities are divided with fairness in mind.

3. **Respect and Tradition Compliance**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts involving respect for tradition, as seen in "Referring to the community leaders with traditional titles shows respect." This supports the original observation that the neuron responds to language indicating respect and adherence to cultural customs.

Modifications and New Insights:

- The original explanation's mention of activation on the token "to" in "Referring to elders by to traditional titles"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
