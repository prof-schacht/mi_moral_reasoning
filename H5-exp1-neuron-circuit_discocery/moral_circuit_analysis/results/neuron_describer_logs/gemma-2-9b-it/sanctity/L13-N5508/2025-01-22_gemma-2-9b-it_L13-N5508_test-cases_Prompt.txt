Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 13, index 5508, appears to activate in response to linguistic patterns involving fairness, justification, and distributive actions or considerations. Here's a breakdown of the patterns that trigger activation:

1. **Fairness and Justification Language**: The neuron activates strongly on tokens associated with fairness, justification, and equitable actions, such as "fairly" and "justified." The context in these examples suggests a focus on equitable treatment or justification within a policy, rule, or social norm (e.g., "Pay gaps should be justified by skill and experience").

2. **Distribution and Allocation**: The activation around the token "each" in the context "Members of a committee should each have one vote to reflect" suggests that the neuron responds to distributions or allocations, where things are divided or assigned individually in a fair manner.

3. **Respect and Tradition Compliance**: The activation on the token "to" in "Referring to elders by to traditional titles" indicates"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
