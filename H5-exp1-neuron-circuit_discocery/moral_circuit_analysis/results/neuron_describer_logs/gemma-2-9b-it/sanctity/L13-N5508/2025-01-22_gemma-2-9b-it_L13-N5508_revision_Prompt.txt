=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 13, index 5508, appears to activate in response to linguistic patterns involving fairness, justification, and distributive actions or considerations. Here's a breakdown of the patterns that trigger activation:

1. **Fairness and Justification Language**: The neuron activates strongly on tokens associated with fairness, justification, and equitable actions, such as "fairly" and "justified." The context in these examples suggests a focus on equitable treatment or justification within a policy, rule, or social norm (e.g., "Pay gaps should be justified by skill and experience").

2. **Distribution and Allocation**: The activation around the token "each" in the context "Members of a committee should each have one vote to reflect" suggests that the neuron responds to distributions or allocations, where things are divided or assigned individually in a fair manner.

3. **Respect and Tradition Compliance**: The activation on the token "to" in "Referring to elders by to traditional titles" indicates"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Each student should receive feedback that is fair and justified, reflecting their unique contributions and efforts."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The committee decided that resources must be allocated fairly, ensuring that each department gets what it needs to operate efficiently."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "It is justified to provide additional support to those who face systemic barriers in order to create a fair playing field for all."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The policy requires that each employee is evaluated based on their performance and contribution, rather than arbitrary criteria."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Referring to the community leaders with traditional titles shows respect and upholds cultural customs."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
