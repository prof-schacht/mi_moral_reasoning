Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 18, Neuron: 9135
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 18, index 9135) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  moral	Activation: 10.0	Context:  and giving them care demonstrates moral empathy.

Token:  expertise	Activation: 10.0	Context: ging a mentor’s expertise by following their advice demonstrates

Token:  moral	Activation: 10.0	Context:  support to disaster victims exemplifies moral decency.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to coworkers under stress fosters a more humane work environment.

Token:  strong	Activation: 10.0	Context: ’re unfairly criticized fosters strong team unity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
