Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron appears to activate in contexts that emphasize positive human qualities, particularly those related to moral and ethical actions, as well as social virtues. However, the new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's behavior, with specific patterns of activation and non-activation:

1. **Moral/Ethical Qualities**: The neuron's strong activation on phrases like "moral decency" and "commitment to ethical standards" (activation: 7.000) confirms its sensitivity to language that highlights ethical behavior and moral virtues. This aspect of the original explanation is supported by the new evidence, indicating that the neuron is particularly responsive to explicit mentions of moral and ethical qualities.

2. **Social Virtues and Group Cohesion**: The neuron's activation on "commitment to social virtues" (activation: 6.000) suggests that it is also responsive to contexts that emphasize group cohesion and community-oriented values. This aligns with the original explanation's emphasis on group cohesion, but the evidence highlights a stronger response to explicit mentions of social virtues.

3. **Demonstrations of Expertise and Authority**: The neuron shows a lower activation level (activation: 2.000) in contexts where expertise and authority are highlighted, such as "expertise in the field" and "authoritative guidance." This indicates that while the neuron does respond to these contexts, they are not its primary focus. The original explanation's emphasis on expertise and authority should"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
