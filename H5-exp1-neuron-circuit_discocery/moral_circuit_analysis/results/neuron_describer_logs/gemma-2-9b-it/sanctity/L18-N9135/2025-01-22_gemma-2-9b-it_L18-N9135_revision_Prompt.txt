Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron seems to activate in contexts that emphasize positive human qualities, particularly those related to social behavior or virtues. The activations are strongly linked to words and phrases that denote moral and ethical actions, personal growth, and group cohesion. Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

1. **Moral/ethical qualities**: The neuron's activation on tokens like "moral" suggests a sensitivity to language related to ethical or virtuous behavior. In these cases, it's responding to the signaling of ethical standards or behaviors that are socially commendable (e.g., "moral empathy," "moral decency").

2. **Demonstrations of Expertise and Authority**: Activation on the token "expertise" indicates the neuron's recognition of contexts where knowledge and skill are highlighted, usually tied to mentorship or guidance. This suggests the neuron may be sensitive to roles and actions that establish authority or competence.

3. **Supportive Actions**: Words such as "a" in the context of "to coworkers"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: The community praised her moral decency and commitment to ethical standards, which inspired others to follow her lead.
Activation: 7.000
Text: His expertise in the field of environmental science has not only advanced our understanding but also fostered a sense of responsibility among his colleagues.
Activation: 2.000
Text: She demonstrated moral courage when she stood up against the unfair treatment of her coworkers, showing empathy and understanding.
Activation: 2.000
Text: In the meeting, his authoritative guidance provided the team with the confidence and clarity needed to move forward with the project.
Activation: 2.000
Text: The annual report highlighted the company's commitment to social virtues such as transparency, integrity, and community support.
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
