Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 15, Neuron: 10407
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 15, index 10407) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>We have a moral a to report and

Token:  mend	Activation: 10.0	Context:  out to estranged relatives to mend bridges exemplifies loyalty to family

Token: re	Activation: 10.0	Context: , even if theyâ€™re tough, shows commitment.

Token:  within	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Working through disagreements within within family rather than walking

Token:  part	Activation: 10.0	Context:  heard first in meetings as part of the hierarchy.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
