=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 15, index 10407, appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with connecting or bridging ideas, particularly involving relationships or hierarchical structures. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern based on the provided examples:

1. **Token: "a" in "a moral a"**: The neuron's activation on the token "a" might seem unusual, but it occurs within the phrase "a moral a to report and," suggesting the neuron's sensitivity to phrases setting up a connection or justification, often introduced by articles like "a" or "an." Here, "moral" introduces a discussion about ethical considerations which can bridge different ideas or topics.

2. **Token: "mend" in "mend bridges exemplifies loyalty"**: The neuron strongly activates on "mend," which clearly signifies repair and reconnection. The phrase "mend bridges" is a metaphor for restoring relationships, perfectly aligning with the neuron's pattern of detecting restorative or connective actions."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
