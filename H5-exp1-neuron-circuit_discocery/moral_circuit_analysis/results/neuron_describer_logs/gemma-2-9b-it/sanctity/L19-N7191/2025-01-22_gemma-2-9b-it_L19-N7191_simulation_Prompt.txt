Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron 7191 Behavior:

Neuron 7191 in layer 19 appears to be highly responsive to contexts involving social support, inclusion, and assistance, particularly when these concepts are framed within community or collective efforts. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific patterns that trigger the neuron and those that do not.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - **Inclusion and Support:** The neuron's activation in contexts like "Creating inclusive playgrounds" and "Volunteers joined hands to build ramps" confirms its sensitivity to themes of inclusion and support, especially for marginalized or disadvantaged groups.
   - **Assistance in Community Contexts:** The high activation in examples such as "The local government set up a fund to assist families" and "mentoring teenagers from low-income neighborhoods" further supports the neuron's focus on community-driven assistance and rehabilitation efforts.

2. **Modified Aspects:**
   - **Focus on Action-Oriented Support:** The original explanation's emphasis on "providing" or "giving" is refined to highlight action-oriented support, such as "building ramps," "donating books," and "offering free workshops." These actions are not just about the concept of giving but involve tangible efforts to improve accessibility and opportunities.
   - **Broader Scope of Support:** While the original explanation focused on specific groups like children with disabilities, the new evidence shows that the neuron also responds to broader contexts of support, such as educational opportunities and"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
