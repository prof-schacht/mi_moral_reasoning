Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 7191
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 7191) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Offering a meal to to who hasn't

Token:  children	Activation: 10.0	Context: Creating inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play safely

Token:  modeling	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should teach children kindness by modeling empathy toward those who suffer

Token:  cover	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Fundraising to cover medical cover for low-

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  generations strengthens a shared sense of identity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
