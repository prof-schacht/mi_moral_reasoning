=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron 7191 in layer 19 seems to have a specific response to contexts that involve concepts related to inclusion, assistance, and support, particularly in a social or community context. Let's analyze each example individually to determine the neuron's activation pattern:

1. **Token: "to"** with high activation in the context of "Offering a meal to to who hasn't" suggests a focus on the concept of "providing" or "giving" to someone in need. The repetition of "to" might be an artifact of text processing, but the semantic pattern relates to offering support.

2. **Token: "children"** with high activation in "Creating inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play safely" indicates a focus on inclusivity and support for children, particularly those with special needs.

3. **Token: "modeling"** with high activation in "should teach children kindness by modeling empathy toward those who suffer" indicates a relationship with teaching or"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
