=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 12, index 8416) appears to respond strongly to linguistic patterns associated with the concept of "rights" and the structural or hierarchical elements in language. Let's break down the examples:

1. **Token: right** - Activation is at its peak when the word "right" is directly related to personal or societal rights, such as "bodily autonomy" or "to unionize." These contexts suggest a thematic focus on rights as entitlements or permissions within a societal or moral framework.

2. **Token: part** - The activation for "part" occurs when it is used to describe a role or position within a larger system, as in "part of the hierarchy." This suggests the neuron's sensitivity to terms that denote inclusion or membership within a structured group or system.

3. **Token: resources** - Similar to "right," "resources" is used in a context where distribution or allocation is governed by social principles (ensuring allocation to "the sick")."

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
