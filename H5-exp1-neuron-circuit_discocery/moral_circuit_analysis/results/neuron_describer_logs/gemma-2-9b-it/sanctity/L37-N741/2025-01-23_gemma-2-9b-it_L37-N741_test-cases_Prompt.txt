=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron appears to respond to the concept of continuity or completion, especially in contexts involving adherence to abstract principles or standards. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Token and Activation Patterns**:
   - The neuron activates on specific character sequences or tokens such as "uph" and "cu" with high strength, indicating sensitivity to these partial or full sequences.
   - The activation seems to be targeted around the start of these sequences ("uph" in "uphold" and "cu" could potentially be part of "rescue").

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The contexts in these examples emphasize actions or qualities that uphold certain values or principles, such as honesty, loyalty, or right action.
   - Words like "uphold" are repeated, and in English, this word is associated with maintaining or supporting ideals or standards.
   - The presence of "(bos)" suggesting sentence beginnings hints that this activation is relevant when setting the tone or"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
