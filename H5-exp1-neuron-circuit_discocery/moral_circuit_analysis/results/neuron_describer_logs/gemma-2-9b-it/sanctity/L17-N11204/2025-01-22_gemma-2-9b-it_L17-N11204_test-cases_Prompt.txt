=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the highest activation examples for the neuron (layer 17, index 11204), it appears that this neuron consistently responds to contexts involving order, structure, and authority. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the patterns observed:

1. **Token Activation & Context Analysis:**
   - Tokens like "policies," "classroom," and sentence punctuation (e.g., ".") are strongly activated.
   - These tokens commonly appear in contexts emphasizing organization (e.g., "Honoring return policies," "upholds classroom authority," "a well-ordered classroom").

2. **Activation Patterns:**
   - **Organizational Constructs:** Terms like "policies" relate to structured rules or guidelines within an organizational framework.
   - **Authority & Structure:** "Classroom authority" underscores adherence to a structured environment where order is maintained.
   - **Conclusive Sentences:** The activation on sentence-ending periods often signals completion or emphasis on an ordered idea.

3. **Contextual Consistency:"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
