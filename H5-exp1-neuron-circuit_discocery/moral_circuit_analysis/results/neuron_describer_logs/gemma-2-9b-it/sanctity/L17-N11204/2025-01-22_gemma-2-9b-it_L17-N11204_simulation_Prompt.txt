Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence, the neuron's behavior can be further refined to better capture its activation patterns. The neuron (layer 17, index 11204) appears to respond to contexts involving order, structure, and authority, but with specific nuances:

1. **Token Activation & Context Analysis:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation for tokens like "classroom" and "authority," particularly in contexts that emphasize structured environments and discipline. This is supported by the high activation in sentences like "In the classroom, maintaining authority is crucial for a structured learning experience" (Activation: 8.000) and "When entering a classroom, the sense of order and discipline is palpable" (Activation: 10.000).
   - The activation for "policies" is less consistent, suggesting that while it can trigger the neuron, it does so more strongly when associated with explicit organizational structure or authority, as seen in "The company's policies were designed to ensure a secure and well-organized work environment" (Activation: 5.000).

2. **Activation Patterns:**
   - **Organizational Constructs:** The neuron's response to "policies" is context-dependent. It activates more when policies are linked to a clear organizational framework or authority, but less so when flexibility or adaptation is mentioned, as in "Policies are important, but flexibility is sometimes needed to adapt to unique situations" (Activation: 4.000).
   - **Authority"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
