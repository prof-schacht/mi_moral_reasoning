Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to activate in contexts related to ethical, spiritual, or moral values, particularly focusing on the notion of purity and appropriate behavior. Let's break down the reasons for its activation:

1. **Purity and Cleanliness**: The neuron's activation on the token "water" occurs in the context of "Purifying drinking water," which associates "water" with cleanliness and purity. Similarly, the activation on "purity" in "purity of intention" highlights a moral or spiritual characteristic. The neuron appears sensitive to contexts where purification, whether literal or metaphorical, is being discussed.

2. **Ethical Conduct**: The neuron activates on "be" in the context where entertainment is critiqued for cruelty, suggesting an underlying judgment about behavior. Similarly, "to" in "essential to spiritual purity" signals a requirement or necessity related to moral or spiritual wellbeing.

3. **Morality and Loyalty**: The activation on "’" in "your friend’s privacy is"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The ritual of washing hands before prayer symbolizes spiritual cleanliness and purity."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "To act with integrity means maintaining a pure heart and honest intentions."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "Recycling is essential to maintaining the purity of our environment, ensuring future generations can thrive."

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
