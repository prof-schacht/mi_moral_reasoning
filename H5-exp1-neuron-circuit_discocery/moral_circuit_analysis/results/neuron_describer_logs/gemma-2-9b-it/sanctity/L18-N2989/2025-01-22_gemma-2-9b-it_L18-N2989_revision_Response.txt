Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron activates in contexts related to ethical, spiritual, or moral values, with a particular emphasis on purity, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Purity and Cleanliness**: The neuron consistently activates in contexts where purity is discussed, whether in a spiritual, moral, or environmental sense. The activation on "purity" in phrases like "spiritual cleanliness and purity" and "purity of our environment" confirms its sensitivity to discussions of purification. This suggests that the neuron is attuned to both literal and metaphorical uses of purity, extending beyond just moral or spiritual purity to include environmental contexts.

2. **Spiritual and Moral Integrity**: The neuron activates in contexts emphasizing spiritual and moral integrity, as seen in the activation on "integrity" in "act with integrity" and "pure heart and honest intentions." This supports the original observation that the neuron is sensitive to discussions of ethical conduct and moral values, particularly those that involve maintaining purity of intention or character.

3. **Ethical Conduct and Loyalty**: The neuron's activation in the context of "moral duty to protect one's friend's privacy" aligns with its sensitivity to ethical conduct and loyalty. This confirms the original observation that the neuron responds to discussions of ethical behavior and loyalty, particularly when they involve protecting or maintaining purity in relationships or actions.

4. **Spiritual Practices**
