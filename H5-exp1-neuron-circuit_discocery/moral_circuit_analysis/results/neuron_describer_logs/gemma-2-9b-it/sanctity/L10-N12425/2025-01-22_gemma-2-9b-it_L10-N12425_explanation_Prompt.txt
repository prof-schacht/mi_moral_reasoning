Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 10, Neuron: 12425
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 10, index 12425) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  religious	Activation: 10.0	Context: Performing ablutions before religious ceremonies demonstrates purity of intention

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  traditions in some religions reflects a commitment to purity.

Token:  virtuous	Activation: 10.0	Context:  body through healthy practices is virtuous.

Token:  reverence	Activation: 10.0	Context:  them free from pollutants demonstrates reverence.

Token:  religious	Activation: 10.0	Context: Wearing modest attire in certain religious settings upholds community standards

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
