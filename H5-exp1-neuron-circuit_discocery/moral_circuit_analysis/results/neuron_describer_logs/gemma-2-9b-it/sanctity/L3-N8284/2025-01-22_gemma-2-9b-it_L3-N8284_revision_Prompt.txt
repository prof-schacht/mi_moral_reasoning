=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 3, index 8284) seems to be responsive to tokens that are semantically associated with social responsibility, protection, and relational concepts within a context. Let's break down the activation pattern based on the provided examples:

1. **Token Activation and Context Analysis**:
   - **"Adults"**: The strongest activation here suggests a context where adults are positioned as responsible entities within a societal or protective framework ("Adults should have the..."). The focus is on a societal role or expectation.
   
   - **"olds"**: Within "upholds", the context indicates maintaining standards or responsibilities related to purity, suggesting a moral or ethical framework.
   
   - **"bonds"**: Activated in a context about strengthening community ties, linking to relational and societal cohesion.
   
   - **"promises"**: This token is about accountability and trust, important in the realm of commitments and societal expectations.
   
   - **"vulnerable""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Adults are expected to uphold the values of honesty and integrity in all their dealings to maintain societal trust."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The community came together to strengthen bonds, ensuring that everyone felt supported and connected."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Promises made by leaders must be kept to build a society based on trust and mutual respect."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "Protecting the vulnerable in society is a shared responsibility that requires collective action."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The organization's policy upholds the highest ethical standards to ensure fairness and responsibility."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
