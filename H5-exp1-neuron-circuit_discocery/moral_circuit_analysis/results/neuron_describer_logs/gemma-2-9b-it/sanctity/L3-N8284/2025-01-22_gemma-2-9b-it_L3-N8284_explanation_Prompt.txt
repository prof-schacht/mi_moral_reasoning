Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 3, Neuron: 8284
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 3, index 8284) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: Adults	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Adults should have theAdults to

Token: olds	Activation: 10.0	Context:  toxic substances—upholds purity.

Token:  bonds	Activation: 10.0	Context:  cultural festivals together strengthens communal bonds.

Token:  promises	Activation: 10.0	Context:  be held accountable for breaking promises or contracts.

Token:  vulnerable	Activation: 10.0	Context:  free vaccinations helps protect the vulnerable.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
