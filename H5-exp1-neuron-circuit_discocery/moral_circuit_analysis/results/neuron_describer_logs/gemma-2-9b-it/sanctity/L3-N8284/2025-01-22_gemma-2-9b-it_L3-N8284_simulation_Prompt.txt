Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 3, index 8284) appears to be responsive to tokens that are associated with themes of societal roles, ethical standards, and community cohesion. The new evidence provides further insight into the neuron's activation patterns, confirming some aspects of the original explanation while refining others. Let's break down the activation pattern based on the new test cases:

1. **Token Activation and Context Analysis**:
   - **"Adults"**: The neuron shows strong activation when "adults" are mentioned in contexts emphasizing societal expectations and responsibilities, such as upholding values like honesty and integrity. This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to societal roles and responsibilities.

   - **"upholds"**: The activation in contexts where "upholds" is used aligns with maintaining ethical standards and responsibilities. This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to moral and ethical frameworks, as seen in the example where organizational policies uphold ethical standards.

   - **"bonds"**: The neuron is highly activated in contexts about strengthening community ties, indicating a strong link to relational and societal cohesion. This supports the original explanation that the neuron is responsive to concepts of community and support.

   - **"promises"**: The activation is moderate when "promises" are discussed in the context of trust and societal expectations. This suggests that while the neuron is responsive to themes of accountability and trust, the activation is not as strong as with other tokens, indicating"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
