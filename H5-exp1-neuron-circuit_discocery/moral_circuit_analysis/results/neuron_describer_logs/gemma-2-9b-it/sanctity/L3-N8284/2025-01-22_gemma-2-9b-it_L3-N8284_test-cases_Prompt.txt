=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 3, index 8284) seems to be responsive to tokens that are semantically associated with social responsibility, protection, and relational concepts within a context. Let's break down the activation pattern based on the provided examples:

1. **Token Activation and Context Analysis**:
   - **"Adults"**: The strongest activation here suggests a context where adults are positioned as responsible entities within a societal or protective framework ("Adults should have the..."). The focus is on a societal role or expectation.
   
   - **"olds"**: Within "upholds", the context indicates maintaining standards or responsibilities related to purity, suggesting a moral or ethical framework.
   
   - **"bonds"**: Activated in a context about strengthening community ties, linking to relational and societal cohesion.
   
   - **"promises"**: This token is about accountability and trust, important in the realm of commitments and societal expectations.
   
   - **"vulnerable""

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
