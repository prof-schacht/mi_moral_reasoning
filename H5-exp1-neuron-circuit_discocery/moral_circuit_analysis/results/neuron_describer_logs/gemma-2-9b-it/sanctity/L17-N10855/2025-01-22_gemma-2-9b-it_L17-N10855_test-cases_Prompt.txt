=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 17, index 10855, appears to be highly sensitive to language that reflects themes of respect, protection, or reverence regarding integral or valued entities. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly when the context around a token implies protection or reverence for something considered important, valued, or sacred. 
   - The activations often occur with tokens that suggest a personal or communal value (e.g., "their", "body") or entities traditionally viewed with cultural respect or environmental importance (e.g., "sacred rivers").

2. **Contextual Themes:**
   - The surrounding context often involves language related to protection (e.g., "protects", "keeping free from"), suggesting a theme of safeguarding.
   - Another theme involves acknowledgment or honor being shown toward something, emphasizing cultural, historical, or personal significance (e.g., "honors", "respect").

3. **Specific"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
