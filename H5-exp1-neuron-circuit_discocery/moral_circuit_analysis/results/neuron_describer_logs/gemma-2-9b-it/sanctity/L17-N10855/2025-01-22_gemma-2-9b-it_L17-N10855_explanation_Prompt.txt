Layer: 17, Neuron: 10855
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 10855) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  their	Activation: 10.0	Context:  sacred texts from damage honors their historical and cultural significance.

Token: s	Activation: 10.0	Context:  overuse protects the soil’s sanctity.

Token:  can	Activation: 10.0	Context:  marketplace of ideas where truth can emerge.

Token:  rivers	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Honoring sacred rivers rivers keeping them free from

Token:  body	Activation: 10.0	Context:  respect for one’s body.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
