Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 22, Neuron: 7075
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 22, index 7075) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  respect	Activation: 10.0	Context:  sacred texts, with careful respect is important.

Token:  society	Activation: 10.0	Context:  of assembly underpin a free society.

Token:  smoothly	Activation: 10.0	Context:  guidance keeps a company functioning smoothly.

Token:  expertise	Activation: 10.0	Context: ging a mentorâ€™s expertise by following their advice demonstrates

Token:  significance	Activation: 10.0	Context:  honors their historical and cultural significance.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
