Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 21, Neuron: 7558
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 21, index 7558) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  speech allows for a marketplace of ideas where truth can emerge

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  debate on controversial topics fosters a truly free society.

Token: ally	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should treat all participants impartially.

Token:  one	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a committee should each have one vote to reflect equality.

Token: ph	Activation: 10.0	Context:  or toxic substancesâ€”upholds purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
