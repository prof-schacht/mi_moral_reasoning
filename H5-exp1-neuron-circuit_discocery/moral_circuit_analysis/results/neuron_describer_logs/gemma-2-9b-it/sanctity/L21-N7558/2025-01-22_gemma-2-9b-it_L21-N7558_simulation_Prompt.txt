Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question demonstrates a more nuanced activation pattern than initially described. The new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is influenced by specific semantic themes and contexts, but not uniformly across all instances of related concepts. Here is a refined explanation based on the new evidence:

1. **Grammatical Role and Position**: The original hypothesis that the neuron activates based on specific grammatical structures, such as prepositions and articles preceding nouns or abstractions, is not strongly supported by the new evidence. The test cases show varying activation levels regardless of these grammatical constructs. Therefore, this aspect should be de-emphasized in the explanation.

2. **Semantic Themes**: The neuron does appear to respond to themes related to fairness, equity, and foundational principles, as seen in the high activation for "The marketplace of ideas" (7.000) and "A truly balanced approach to justice" (2.000). These contexts involve abstract ideals and principles, suggesting that the neuron is sensitive to discussions that emphasize intellectual equality and balanced justice.

3. **Contexts of Activation**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts that involve abstract and idealistic discussions, particularly those that emphasize the coexistence of diverse thoughts or balanced approaches. However, it does not activate for all instances of fairness or equality, as seen in the zero activation for "The principles of fairness and equality are enshrined in the constitution." This indicates that the neuron may be more responsive to dynamic or action"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
