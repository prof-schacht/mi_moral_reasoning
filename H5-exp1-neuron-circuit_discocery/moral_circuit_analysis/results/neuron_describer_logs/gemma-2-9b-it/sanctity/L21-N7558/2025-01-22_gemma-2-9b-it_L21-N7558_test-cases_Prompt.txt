=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate based on its detection of certain linguistic patterns that relate to concepts of equality, impartiality, or purity within text, often in formal or abstract discussions. This is discerned from consistent themes across the examples:

1. **Grammatical Role and Position**: The neuron activates on specific grammatical structures, such as prepositions and articles ("of", "a") that precede nouns or abstractions in theoretical or formal constructs. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to linguistic constructs that initiate or emphasize an idea or concept, which often follows these tokens.

2. **Semantic Themes**: The surrounding contexts of the activations—like "marketplace of ideas", "truly free society", "impartially", "reflect equality", and "upholds purity"—point towards themes of fairness, equity, and foundational principles. The neuron likely responds to language invoking universal or abstract ideals.

3. **Contexts of Activation**: The activations are strong in contexts"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
