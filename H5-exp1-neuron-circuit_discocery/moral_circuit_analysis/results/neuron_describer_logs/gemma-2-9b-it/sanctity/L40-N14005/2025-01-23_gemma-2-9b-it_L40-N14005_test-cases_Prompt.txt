=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron, located at layer 40, index 14005, appears to activate in response to linguistic patterns related to moral or ethical guidance and the advocacy of positive social behavior. Let's break down the examples to understand the specific patterns that trigger activation:

1. **Refraining from negative gossip about friends upholds loyalty**: The token "gossip" triggers maximum activation (10.0). The context implies a directive or a social norm related to maintaining harmonious and loyal relationships by avoiding negative speech.

2. **Actively listen to friends who are experiencing emotional pain**: The token “are” activates (10.0) likely due to its proximity to a phrase that describes an empathetic behavior. This suggests that the activation is linked to the advocacy of supportive social interactions.

3. **We should speak out should bullying to**: The token “should” activates twice in succession. This pattern suggests a strong response to normative statements about moral actions, especially those directing against wrongful acts like bullying"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
