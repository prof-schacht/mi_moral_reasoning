Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron located at layer 40, index 14005, was initially thought to activate in response to linguistic patterns related to moral or ethical guidance and the advocacy of positive social behavior. However, new evidence suggests a more nuanced understanding of its activation patterns. Let's reassess the specific patterns that trigger activation:

1. **Original Explanation Reassessment**:
   - The original examples suggested that the neuron activates in response to moral directives or social norms, such as refraining from gossip or advocating for supportive interactions. However, the new test cases, which also contain moral and ethical guidance, did not trigger the neuron, indicating that the presence of moral content alone is insufficient for activation.

2. **Patterns That Do Not Trigger Activation**:
   - The new evidence shows that phrases advocating kindness, sincerity, responsibility, charity, and adherence to rules do not trigger the neuron. This suggests that the neuron does not respond to general moral or ethical statements, even when they are explicit and directive.

3. **Refined Activation Patterns**:
   - The original examples highlighted specific tokens like "gossip," "are," and "should" as triggers. It appears that the neuron's activation is more closely tied to specific linguistic structures or contexts rather than the moral content itself. The activation might be linked to certain syntactic or semantic patterns, such as the presence of specific verbs or auxiliary verbs in particular contexts, rather than the broader theme of ethical behavior.

4. **New Insights"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
