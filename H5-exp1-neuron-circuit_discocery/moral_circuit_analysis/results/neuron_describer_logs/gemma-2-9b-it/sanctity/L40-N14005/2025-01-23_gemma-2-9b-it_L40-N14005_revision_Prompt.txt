Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron, located at layer 40, index 14005, appears to activate in response to linguistic patterns related to moral or ethical guidance and the advocacy of positive social behavior. Let's break down the examples to understand the specific patterns that trigger activation:

1. **Refraining from negative gossip about friends upholds loyalty**: The token "gossip" triggers maximum activation (10.0). The context implies a directive or a social norm related to maintaining harmonious and loyal relationships by avoiding negative speech.

2. **Actively listen to friends who are experiencing emotional pain**: The token “are” activates (10.0) likely due to its proximity to a phrase that describes an empathetic behavior. This suggests that the activation is linked to the advocacy of supportive social interactions.

3. **We should speak out should bullying to**: The token “should” activates twice in succession. This pattern suggests a strong response to normative statements about moral actions, especially those directing against wrongful acts like bullying"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "We must always strive to be kind and considerate in our interactions, especially when someone is feeling down."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Avoid spreading rumors even when it seems tempting, as it helps to build trust and respect within the community."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "It is important to apologize sincerely when you've hurt someone, as taking responsibility for your actions is a vital part of ethical behavior."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Donating to charities that support underprivileged children is a noble act that aligns with our moral duty to help those in need."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "Even though the rules are strict, we must follow them to ensure fairness and equality for everyone involved."
Activation: 0.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
