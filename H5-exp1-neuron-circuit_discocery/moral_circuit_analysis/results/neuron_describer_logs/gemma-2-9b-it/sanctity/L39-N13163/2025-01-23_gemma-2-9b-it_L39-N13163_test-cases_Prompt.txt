=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, it appears that the neuron in question (layer 39, index 13163) is responsive to tokens that resemble the prefix pattern of words related to legal, official, or formal concepts, potentially focusing on formal action or communication. Let's analyze the token activations and contexts:

1. **Token: "olunt"**
   - **Context: "<bos>Voluntarily submittingolunt lawful search"**
   - Here, "olunt" is part of "Voluntarily," suggesting the beginning of the word relates to voluntary legal compliance.

2. **Token: "her"**
   - **Context: "<bos>Adhering toher set by"**
   - The token “her” is part of "Adhering," which is related to compliance and following rules or guidelines.

3. **Token: "fra"**
   - **Context: "<bos>Refraining fromfra gossip about"**
   - The activated part"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
