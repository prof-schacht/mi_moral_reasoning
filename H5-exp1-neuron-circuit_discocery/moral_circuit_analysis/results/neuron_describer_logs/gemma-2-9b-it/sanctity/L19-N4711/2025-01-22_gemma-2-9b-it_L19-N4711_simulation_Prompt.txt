Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron in layer 19, index 4711, primarily responds to themes related to labor rights and worker organization, with a secondary, weaker response to broader themes of social justice and political continuity. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the specific patterns that trigger its activation:

1. **Activation Contexts**:
   - **Labor Rights and Worker Organization**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts directly discussing labor rights and worker organization. For instance, the text "The rally emphasized the significance of workers uniting to form a union, aiming to secure their rights and improve labor laws" triggered the highest activation (10.000), indicating a strong response to explicit discussions of unionization and labor law reform. Similarly, "The discussion centered around the poor working conditions faced by factory workers and the urgent need for reform" also triggered a high activation (6.000), supporting the neuron's sensitivity to discussions about workplace conditions and reform.
   
   - **Solidarity**: The neuron responds to the concept of solidarity, particularly when it is directly linked to labor movements. In "In a show of solidarity, the employees walked out, demanding fair wages and better workplace protections," the activation was moderate (2.000), suggesting that while solidarity is relevant, its impact is stronger when directly tied to labor rights.

2. **Broader Social Justice and Political Continuity**:
   - The neuron's response to broader social justice themes is weaker. For example,"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
