Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 4711
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 4711) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  conditions	Activation: 10.0	Context:  quit a job if working conditions are poor is an essential

Token:  solidarity	Activation: 10.0	Context: â€™re injured demonstrates caring solidarity.

Token:  workers	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Granting workers the workers to unionize

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  historical figures in government fosters a sense of continuity and order

Token:  unjust	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to move and travel without unjust barriers.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
