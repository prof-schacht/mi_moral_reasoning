=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron in layer 19, index 4711, appears to respond to tokens that are related to themes of labor rights, social justice, and political continuity. Let's break down the specific patterns that trigger its activation:

1. **Activation Contexts**:
   - **"conditions"**: The context suggests a discussion about workplace environments, specifically unfavorable ones. The activation happens with "working conditions," a frequently discussed topic in labor rights discourse.
   - **"solidarity"**: This token is heavily associated with unity and collective support, especially in contexts such as worker movements and social activism.
   - **"workers"**: This is a literal keyword connected to labor discussions. In the given context, the term relates to organizing or unionization efforts.
   - **"a"**: Although this might seem like an outlier, the surrounding context ("historical figures in government") suggests themes of tradition and continuity in political structures, which might align with broader systemic or societal themes"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The discussion centered around the poor working conditions faced by factory workers and the urgent need for reform."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "In a show of solidarity, the employees walked out, demanding fair wages and better workplace protections."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The rally emphasized the significance of workers uniting to form a union, aiming to secure their rights and improve labor laws."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "Historical figures in government have often grappled with maintaining political continuity while addressing societal changes."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The concept of solidarity extends beyond workers to include broader social justice movements advocating for equality."
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
