=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located in layer 26 at index 12673, appears to primarily respond to contexts related to the application of principles or concepts that ensure uniformity, equivalence, or consistency. Let's break down its behavior based on the examples provided:

1. **Function Words and Conjunctions (e.g., "as," "or"):** 
   - These tokens are often used to compare or equate different elements in a sentence. For example, "as important as" implies a comparison or equivalence between two actions or qualities. Similarly, "certain foods or drinks" presents options that are subject to a similar rule or condition.

2. **Morphenes and Word Fragments (e.g., "fy"):**
   - The fragment "fy" is in the context of "sanctify," a word that implies an action that imparts a certain approved or respected status to something â€” a form of equivalence or acceptance to a certain standard.

3. **Articles"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
