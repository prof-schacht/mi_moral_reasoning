Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 25, Neuron: 3821
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 3821) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  any	Activation: 10.0	Context:  free to join or leave any political party without repercussions.

Token:  any	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Citizens can relocate to any region they desire without state

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Freedom to quit a a if working conditions are

Token:  any	Activation: 10.0	Context:  should be free to practice any religion or none at all

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  owners should have the right to operate without excessive licensing requirements

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
