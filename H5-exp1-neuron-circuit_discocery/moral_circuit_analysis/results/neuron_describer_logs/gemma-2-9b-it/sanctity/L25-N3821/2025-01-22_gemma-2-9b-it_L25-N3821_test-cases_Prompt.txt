=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, the neuron at layer 25, index 3821 seems to activate in contexts related to freedom, rights, and the ability to act without constraints. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the patterns that trigger its high activation:

1. **Token Proximity to Freedom-Related Concepts**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly for the token "any" when it appears in contexts discussing freedom of choice or absence of restrictions. In these instances, "any" typically signifies an unrestricted selection, such as in "any political party" or "any region," suggesting the availability of multiple options without limitations.
   - For "a" in "quit a a," even though the context is slightly garbled, the idea hints at the freedom to leave or stop an activity, which still relates to personal liberty or agency.

2. **Contextual Themes**: 
   - The surrounding context consistently involves discussions of rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to choose religion or occupational conditions"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
