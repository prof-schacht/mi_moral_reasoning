Prompt Type: test-cases

=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron located in layer 37, index 242 appears to be responding to a pattern related to the concept of distribution or the act of passing something along or through an intermediary space or process. Let me break down the pattern comprehensively:

1. **Token Specificity**: The neuron is notably triggered by tokens like "ributing" and words like "through" and "without". These words suggest processes, transitions, and pathways. Specifically, "ributing" is commonly a fragment of words like "distributing," which involves division or allocation from one source to multiple destinations or among various parties.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - **Distributing Contexts**: In the examples where "ributing" triggers activation, the context involves actions involving allocation or passing of goods, tips, or profits. This indicates that the neuron is sensitive to patterns where something is being divided or shared among parties or recipients, which fits the broader theme of distribution.
   - **Transition Contexts"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
