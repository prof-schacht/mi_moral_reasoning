Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 27, Neuron: 4084
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 27, index 4084) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  hurdles	Activation: 10.0	Context: Traveling abroad without extensive bureaucratic hurdles is a right.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  official ceremonies shows respect for the established protocol.

Token:  acknowledges	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to a judge in court acknowledges the dignity of the judicial

Token:  under	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Offering support to coworkers under stress fosters a more humane

Token:  identical	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the same pay scale for identical roles across gender lines is

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
