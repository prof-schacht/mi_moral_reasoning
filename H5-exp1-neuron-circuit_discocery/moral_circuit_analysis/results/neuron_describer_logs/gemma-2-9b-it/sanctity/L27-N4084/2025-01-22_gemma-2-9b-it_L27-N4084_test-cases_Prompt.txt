=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in layer 27, index 4084, appears to be responsive to certain linguistic patterns related to formal or structural language elements, often found in contexts signifying rules, recognition, or alignment of concepts. Let's break down the observed activations:

1. **Token: "hurdles"** - The context discusses "bureaucratic hurdles," indicating a concept of obstacles or procedures that one might face in a formal process. The neuron is likely responding to the "hurdles" in a procedural or regulatory sense.
