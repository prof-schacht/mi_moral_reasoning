Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron appears to be detecting patterns related to the concepts of independence, autonomy, and the dynamics of support within hierarchical or relational structures. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the neuron's activation triggers, highlighting both the presence and absence of certain themes. Let's break down the patterns based on the new evidence:

1. **Independence and Autonomy:**
   - The neuron strongly activates in contexts where there is a clear transfer or achievement of independence or autonomy. For example, in the sentence "Through the program, she achieved financial independence from her parents," the high activation (5.000) suggests that the neuron is sensitive to scenarios where personal agency is gained or enhanced. Similarly, "By signing the treaty, the nation was able to reclaim its independence from colonial powers" (activation: 7.000) underscores the neuron's focus on regaining autonomy from controlling entities.

2. **Support and Relational Dynamics:**
   - The neuron also responds to contexts involving support within relational structures, but with less intensity compared to independence themes. In "She offered a shoulder to lean on, giving him the support he needed during a tough time" (activation: 2.000), the activation indicates recognition of support dynamics, though it is not as strong as in independence scenarios.

3. **Hierarchical Structures and Communication:**
   - The activation on "The team structure was designed to facilitate open communication and ensure that everyone had a voice in decision"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
