=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be detecting patterns related to offering or giving independence or support, often in a context that involves a transfer of agency or resources. Let's break down the patterns for each example:

1. **Token: "from" in "Financial independence from state from allows individuals more"**
   - The activation here is likely related to the concept of gaining independence *from* an entity or situation that previously exerted control or influence. The context suggests a transfer of freedom or agency.

2. **Token: "structure" in "meeting etiquette acknowledges the authority structure."**
   - The activation on "structure" might be associated with an acknowledgment or awareness of an existing system or hierarchy, which contrasts with themes of independence but still involves understanding or defining relational dynamics.

3. **Token: "a" in "Offering a listening ear a someone who"**
   - Here, "a" is part of a phrase that implies offering support or resources (in this case, a listening ear), highlighting"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
