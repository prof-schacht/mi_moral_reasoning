Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron (layer 13, index 10000) appears to respond to a pattern related to linguistic elements that involve respect, honor, and responsibility, often within contexts discussing moral or ethical obligations or behaviors.

1. **Exact Pattern Triggering Activation**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens that are part of or lead into phrases discussing concepts of respect, support, or obligation. Specifically, it responds to terms like "are," "the," and punctuation marks ("-" and "â€™") in contexts where they either introduce or form critical parts of statements highlighting ethical or responsible actions.

2. **Context Around Activating Tokens**:
   - **The token "are"** in the context of "Designing public spaces that are friendly" relates to the ethical responsibility of accommodating those with mental health needs, indicating an activation around statements of communal or social responsibility.
   - **The token "-"** within "using performance-enhancing drugs undermines" suggests a break or a"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The leaders are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency in their dealings."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "By ensuring that all policies are inclusive, we demonstrate respect for diverse communities."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Using resources wisely is essential - it reflects a commitment to environmental stewardship."

Text: "The students were reminded that honesty is the cornerstone of academic achievement."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The committee's decision to support the charity event was a testament to their sense of social responsibility."
Activation: 7.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
