Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

Based on the original and new evidence, neuron (layer 13, index 10000) appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with themes of ethical behavior, responsibility, and respect, particularly in contexts discussing integrity, inclusivity, and social responsibility.

1. **Exact Pattern Triggering Activation**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens that are part of phrases or sentences emphasizing ethical standards, social responsibility, and respect for others. It specifically responds to the presence of terms like "are," "is," and punctuation marks ("-") when they are integral to statements highlighting moral or ethical actions or commitments.

2. **Context Around Activating Tokens**:
   - **The token "are"** consistently triggers activation in contexts where it introduces or is part of statements about expectations of ethical behavior or responsibility, such as "leaders are expected to uphold the highest standards" and "policies are inclusive."
   - **The token "-"** is associated with statements that underscore a commitment to responsible actions, as seen in "Using resources wisely is essential - it reflects a commitment to environmental stewardship."
   - **General Context**: The neuron activates in sentences that convey a sense of duty or ethical obligation, such as "honesty is the cornerstone of academic achievement" and "support the charity event was a testament to their sense of social responsibility."

3. **Supported Aspects from Original Explanation**:
   - The original explanation's focus on respect, honor, and responsibility"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
