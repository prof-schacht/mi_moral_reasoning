=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron in Layer 4, index 3897, appears to respond to tokens associated with the expression or support of personal or collective autonomy and identity. Here's the analysis based on the highest activations:

1. **Activation by Single-Word Concepts:**
   - The neuron activates for words like "freely", "term", "information", "freedom", and "colors". These words all convey a sense of autonomy, identity, or support in different contexts. "Freely" and "freedom" directly relate to actions or states without restraint, indicating autonomy or liberty.

2. **Common Linguistic Patterns:**
   - The activation is strongest when these tokens occur within phrases that involve making choices or demonstrating support or identity. For example, "vote freely" implies an unrestricted choice, "product information" suggests transparency enabling better decision-making, and "wearing team colors" indicates a visible expression of identity.

3. **Contextual Theme of Autonomy and Identity:**"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
