Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 13, index 1524, responds to linguistic patterns associated with normative or prescriptive statements, particularly those involving societal norms, rules, or expectations. The new evidence provides further insight into the neuron's activation patterns, confirming some aspects of the original explanation while necessitating modifications and additions.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron's activation on tokens like "to" and "the" in contexts suggesting obligation or permission is supported by the new evidence. For instance, in the sentence "Every individual has the right to express their opinions freely, without fear of retribution or censorship," the neuron's activation is high (7.000), indicating its sensitivity to normative statements about rights and freedoms.
   - The neuron's strong activation on the word "unacceptable" in the context of prescriptive language is confirmed by the example "It is considered unacceptable for employees to use company resources for personal gain," which shows a high activation (10.000). This supports the idea that the neuron responds to language that conveys judgments or rules.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - The original explanation suggested a strong response to function words like "the" in contexts introducing discussions about systems. However, the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation is more closely tied to the presence of prescriptive or normative content rather than the mere presence of these function words. For example, "The law requires that all citizens pay taxes to support"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
