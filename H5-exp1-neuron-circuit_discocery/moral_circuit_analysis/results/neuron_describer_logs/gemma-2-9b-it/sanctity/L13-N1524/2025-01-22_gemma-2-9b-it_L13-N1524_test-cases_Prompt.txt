Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 13, index 1524, appears to respond to certain linguistic patterns associated with normative or prescriptive statements, typically involving societal norms, rules, or expectations. Here's the analysis based on the examples provided:

1. **Token Contexts**:
   - The tokens that the neuron activates strongly on, such as "to," "the," "a," "for," and "unacceptable," are common function words or adjectives related to prescriptive language. Function words often structure prescriptive statements, while adjectives can describe rule-related judgments.

2. **Activation Patterns**:
   - **Token "to"**: Activated in contexts suggesting obligation or permission (e.g., "Citizens must be free to join or leaveâ€¦"), which implies an imperative or normative statement about freedom and rights.
   - **Token "the"**: Activated in a context where it introduces a discussion about maintaining or upholding a system (e.g., "Upholding the the of monarchy"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
