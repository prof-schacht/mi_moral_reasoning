Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 13, index 1524, appears to respond to certain linguistic patterns associated with normative or prescriptive statements, typically involving societal norms, rules, or expectations. Here's the analysis based on the examples provided:

1. **Token Contexts**:
   - The tokens that the neuron activates strongly on, such as "to," "the," "a," "for," and "unacceptable," are common function words or adjectives related to prescriptive language. Function words often structure prescriptive statements, while adjectives can describe rule-related judgments.

2. **Activation Patterns**:
   - **Token "to"**: Activated in contexts suggesting obligation or permission (e.g., "Citizens must be free to join or leaveâ€¦"), which implies an imperative or normative statement about freedom and rights.
   - **Token "the"**: Activated in a context where it introduces a discussion about maintaining or upholding a system (e.g., "Upholding the the of monarchy"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Every individual has the right to express their opinions freely, without fear of retribution or censorship."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "It is considered unacceptable for employees to use company resources for personal gain."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "One must adhere to the established guidelines to ensure safety and compliance at all times."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In certain cultures, it is customary for the eldest child to inherit the family estate."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The law requires that all citizens pay taxes to support public services and infrastructure."
Activation: 8.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
