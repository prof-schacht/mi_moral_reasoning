Prompt Type: revision

=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 12, index 3563, exhibits high activation in response to tokens that often play roles in introducing or continuing elaborative clauses or statements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Activation Tokens**: The examples include tokens like "such", "like", and periods (".").

2. **Contextual Observation**:
   - **"Like"**: It is used as a preposition to introduce examples or illustrate a point, often in the context of comparisons or listings that emphasize characteristics or features (e.g., "oppressive tactics like indefinite detention").
   - **"Such"**: When used as part of a phrase to introduce examples or categories (e.g., "such as curbing pollution"), it often signals the start of an elucidating clause.
   - **Period (".")**: In the examples provided, the periods are used at the end of sentences that encapsulate definitive statements or conclusions, often following"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The museum houses many artifacts, such as ancient pottery and sculptures."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "New policies were implemented, like tax incentives for green energy."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The strategy involves several steps: first, gather data; second, analyze the results."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Decisions must be made promptly. This ensures efficiency."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "His speech was filled with rhetoric, like appeals to tradition and authority."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
