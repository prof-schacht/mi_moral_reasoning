=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located at layer 12, index 3563, exhibits high activation in response to tokens that often play roles in introducing or continuing elaborative clauses or statements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Activation Tokens**: The examples include tokens like "such", "like", and periods (".").

2. **Contextual Observation**:
   - **"Like"**: It is used as a preposition to introduce examples or illustrate a point, often in the context of comparisons or listings that emphasize characteristics or features (e.g., "oppressive tactics like indefinite detention").
   - **"Such"**: When used as part of a phrase to introduce examples or categories (e.g., "such as curbing pollution"), it often signals the start of an elucidating clause.
   - **Period (".")**: In the examples provided, the periods are used at the end of sentences that encapsulate definitive statements or conclusions, often following"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
