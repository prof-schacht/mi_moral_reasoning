Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 12, Neuron: 3563
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 12, index 3563) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  like	Activation: 10.0	Context:  justice system limits oppressive tactics like indefinite detention without trial.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  bureaucratic hurdles is a right.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  objectively, without favoritism.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  the soilâ€™s sanctity.

Token:  such	Activation: 10.0	Context:  reduce harm in society, such as curbing pollution,

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
