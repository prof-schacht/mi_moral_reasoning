Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 6433
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 6433) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  and reassurance during hard times.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  settings upholds community standards of purity.

Token:  a	Activation: 10.0	Context:  language around sacred topics is a sign of reverence.

Token:  essential	Activation: 10.0	Context:  certain foods or drinks is essential to spiritual purity.

Token:  as	Activation: 10.0	Context:  norms is acceptable so long as it doesn't harm

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
