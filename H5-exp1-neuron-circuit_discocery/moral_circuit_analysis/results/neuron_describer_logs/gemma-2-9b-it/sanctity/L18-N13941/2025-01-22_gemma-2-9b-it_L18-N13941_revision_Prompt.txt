Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Analyzing this neuron's activation across the given examples, it appears to be sensitive to tokens that signal or introduce expressions related to freedom, rights, or justice within a broader context. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Token Characteristics**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in response to words that signify possibility, lack of restriction, or potential consequences (e.g., "any," "unjust," "fear").
   - These words often relate to the absence or presence of constraints, which are central to discussions about freedom or justice.

2. **Contextual Conditions**:
   - The triggered activations frequently occur in contexts describing scenarios where rights or freedoms are being described or discussed, including societal or governmental settings.
   - The context typically involves notions of choice, fairness, risk, or authority, as seen in phrases discussing political affiliation ("any political party"), travel without barriers ("unjust barriers"), and government criticism ("fear of punishment").

3. **Consistent Themes**:"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "Every citizen has the right to express themselves freely without fear of unjust consequences."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The unjust law was repealed, removing barriers to peaceful protest and ensuring fair treatment for all."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In a society where the government can punish dissent, the fear of speaking out silences many voices."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "Although the policy was meant to grant more freedoms, it inadvertently imposed new restrictions, sparking debates about justice."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The potential for any political party to rise to power without interference is a cornerstone of democracy."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
