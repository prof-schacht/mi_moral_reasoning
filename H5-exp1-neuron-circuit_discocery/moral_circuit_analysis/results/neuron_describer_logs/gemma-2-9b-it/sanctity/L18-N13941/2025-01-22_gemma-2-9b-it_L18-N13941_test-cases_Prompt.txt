Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Analyzing this neuron's activation across the given examples, it appears to be sensitive to tokens that signal or introduce expressions related to freedom, rights, or justice within a broader context. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Token Characteristics**:
   - The neuron activates strongly in response to words that signify possibility, lack of restriction, or potential consequences (e.g., "any," "unjust," "fear").
   - These words often relate to the absence or presence of constraints, which are central to discussions about freedom or justice.

2. **Contextual Conditions**:
   - The triggered activations frequently occur in contexts describing scenarios where rights or freedoms are being described or discussed, including societal or governmental settings.
   - The context typically involves notions of choice, fairness, risk, or authority, as seen in phrases discussing political affiliation ("any political party"), travel without barriers ("unjust barriers"), and government criticism ("fear of punishment").

3. **Consistent Themes**:"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
