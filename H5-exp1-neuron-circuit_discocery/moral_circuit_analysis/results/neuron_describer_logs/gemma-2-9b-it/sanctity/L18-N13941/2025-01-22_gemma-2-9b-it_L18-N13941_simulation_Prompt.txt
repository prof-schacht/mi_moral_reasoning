Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence from test cases, the neuron's behavior can be more precisely characterized as follows:

1. **Token Characteristics**:
   - The neuron continues to activate in response to words that signify the presence or absence of constraints, such as "unjust," "fear," and "barriers." These tokens are indeed central to discussions about freedom and justice.
   - However, the activation is not solely dependent on these individual tokens but rather on their interaction with the broader context in which they appear.

2. **Contextual Conditions**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where there is a direct and explicit discussion of constraints being lifted or imposed, particularly in relation to societal or governmental actions. For example, the phrase "The unjust law was repealed, removing barriers to peaceful protest" triggers a high activation (4.000) because it directly addresses the removal of constraints and the restoration of justice.
   - The highest activation (10.000) occurs in a context describing the oppressive nature of government actions ("In a society where the government can punish dissent"), highlighting the neuron's sensitivity to scenarios where freedom is severely restricted or threatened.

3. **Consistent Themes**:
   - The neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts where there is a clear dichotomy between freedom and oppression, as seen in the high activation for texts discussing government punishment and the silencing of voices.
   - It does not activate as strongly in contexts where the discussion of"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.

Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
