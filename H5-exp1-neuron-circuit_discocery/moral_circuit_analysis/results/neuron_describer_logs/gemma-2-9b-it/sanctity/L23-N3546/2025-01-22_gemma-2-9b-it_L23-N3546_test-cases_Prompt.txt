=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron exhibits a strong activation pattern in contexts that involve moral or ethical considerations, particularly focusing on actions, decisions, or conditions that promote fairness, protection, and avoidance of bias. Let's break down how the neuron responds to each presented example:

1. **Token: "protect"**  
   **Context:** "...rescuing farm animals to protect them from slaughter is morally..."  
   **Activation Reasoning:** The neuron responds to the notion of 'protection' as an ethically motivated action, possibly associating 'protection' with positive moral actions like preventing harm.

2. **Token: "not"**  
   **Context:** "...by skill and experience, not bias."  
   **Activation Reasoning:** Here, 'not' negates bias, highlighting fairness and impartiality. The neuron is likely detecting a pattern where negation serves to uphold fairness or an unbiased state, aligning with ethical principles.

3. **Token: "bing"**  
   **Context:** "...such"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
