Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 3546
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 3546) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  protect	Activation: 10.0	Context: ting rescued farm animals to protect them from slaughter is morally

Token:  not	Activation: 10.0	Context:  by skill and experience, not bias.

Token: bing	Activation: 10.0	Context:  society, such as curbing pollution, is a moral

Token:  when	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to report and prevent abuse when we see it.

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Applying the same rules for all participants in a game

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
