Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron is primarily activated by contexts involving ethical considerations, particularly those emphasizing fairness, transparency, and the prevention of bias. The new evidence supports and refines the understanding of the neuron's behavior, highlighting specific patterns that trigger its activation.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - **Fairness and Impartiality:** The neuron is strongly activated by contexts that emphasize fairness and impartiality, as seen in examples like "equitable access to education" and "evaluated on merit alone." These contexts align with the neuron's sensitivity to ethical principles that promote fairness.
   - **Avoidance of Bias:** The neuron's activation in contexts such as "avoid any perception of bias" and "prevent any form of discrimination" confirms its responsiveness to scenarios where bias is negated or avoided, supporting the original explanation.

2. **Aspects to Modify or Remove:**
   - **Protection as a Trigger:** While the original explanation suggested a strong response to 'protection' as an ethical action, the new evidence does not specifically highlight protection as a distinct trigger. The focus should shift more towards fairness and transparency rather than protection alone.
   - **Negation as a Trigger:** The original explanation emphasized negation (e.g., "not bias") as a trigger. While negation plays a role, the new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is more directly tied to the presence of fairness and transparency rather than negation itself.

3. **New Patterns"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
