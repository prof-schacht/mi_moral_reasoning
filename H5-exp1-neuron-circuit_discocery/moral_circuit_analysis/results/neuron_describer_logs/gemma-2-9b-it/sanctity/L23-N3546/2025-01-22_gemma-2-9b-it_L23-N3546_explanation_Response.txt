=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron exhibits a strong activation pattern in contexts that involve moral or ethical considerations, particularly focusing on actions, decisions, or conditions that promote fairness, protection, and avoidance of bias. Let's break down how the neuron responds to each presented example:

3. **Token: "bing"**  
   **Context:** "...such
