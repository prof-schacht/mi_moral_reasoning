=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 4, index 11288) appears to respond strongly to the presence of the prefix "Dis-" in the context of verbs, as well as similar morphemic patterns in other contexts, with some variation in activation strength depending on surrounding linguistic structures.

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The majority of the high activation examples include tokens like "Dist" and "Ad," which suggest the neuron is responsive to prefixes like "Dis-" and the context in which they appear. The activation on "Dist" commonly follows structures that imply the beginning of words such as "Distributing" and perhaps "Distributed."
   - "Ad" in "Adhering" also suggests the neuron's sensitivity to prefixes that convey meaning or function, indicating the importance of word-forming elements.

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - The examples show that the neuron often activates when the prefix is part of a verb in the present participle form as seen with"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
