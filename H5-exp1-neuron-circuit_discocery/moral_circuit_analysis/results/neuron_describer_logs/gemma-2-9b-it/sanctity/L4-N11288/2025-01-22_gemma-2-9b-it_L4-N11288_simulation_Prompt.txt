Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 4, index 11288) demonstrates a consistent pattern of activation in response to certain prefixes and their contextual usage, particularly in verbs. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's behavior as follows:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The neuron strongly activates in the presence of the prefix "Dis-" as seen in words like "discussing," "distribute," and "disliked." This confirms the neuron's sensitivity to the "Dis-" prefix, especially when it forms part of verbs.
   - The activation is not limited to "Dis-" alone. The neuron also responds to other prefixes such as "Ad-" in "addressing" and "adhere," as well as "Mal-" in "malfunctioning." This suggests a broader sensitivity to prefixes that modify verbs, indicating a general pattern of recognizing morphemic elements that alter word meaning or function.

2. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - The neuron's activation is consistent across various verb forms, not just the present participle. The examples include verbs in different tenses and forms, such as "disliked" (past tense) and "dispatched" (past participle), indicating that the neuron's response is not restricted to a specific verb form.
   - The context in which these prefixes appear seems to play a role, as the neuron activates in sentences where these verbs are central to the action"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
