Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 23, Neuron: 2640
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 23, index 2640) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  contribution	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to each member's contribution is just.

Token:  defects	Activation: 10.0	Context: Sales staff must disclose product defects to maintain an honest market

Token:  freedom	Activation: 10.0	Context:  state control allows individuals more freedom.

Token:  animal	Activation: 10.0	Context: Stopping to help an injured animal on the road shows respect

Token:  effort	Activation: 10.0	Context:  equally respects everyoneâ€™s effort.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
