Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron responds to tokens that are associated with ethical or moral considerations, particularly when these tokens are part of a structured context that emphasizes responsibility, transparency, or protection of rights. The activation patterns from the new evidence suggest a refined understanding of the neuron's behavior:

1. **Token Contextual Meaning**: The neuron is highly activated by tokens that denote ethical obligations or actions aimed at protecting or enhancing societal values. For example, "effort" and "defects" in contexts that emphasize maintaining peace and consumer protection, respectively, trigger high activation (5.000). This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to contexts where ethical actions are being actively pursued or enforced.

2. **Surrounding Context Influence**: The neuron's activation is influenced by the presence of structured contexts that highlight ethical responsibilities or transparency. The activation for "animal" in the context of welfare (4.000) and "contribution" in the context of financial transparency (2.000) indicates that the neuron's response is stronger when the context involves direct ethical actions or policies. However, "freedom" in the context of rights protection only triggers moderate activation (2.000), suggesting that the neuron is less responsive to abstract ethical concepts unless they are tied to concrete actions or policies.

3. **Patterns and Nuances**: The neuron shows a preference for contexts where ethical considerations are directly linked to actions or policies that have tangible outcomes, such as maintaining peace, rescuing"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
