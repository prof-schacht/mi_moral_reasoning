Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to respond to tokens that denote or imply ethical or moral considerations within a structured context. Letâ€™s analyze the activation patterns based on the provided examples:

1. **Token Contextual Meaning**: Each activating token is a noun that implies a positive moral or ethical value. These tokens - "contribution," "defects," "freedom," "animal," and "effort" - represent concepts that can be associated with virtuous or ethical behavior. 

2. **Surrounding Context Influence**: The context surrounding these tokens often involves a discussion of responsibilities, rights, fairness, or respect. For instance:
   - "Contribution" is within a context emphasizing fairness ("to each member's contribution").
   - "Defects" in the phrase suggests a need for honesty ("disclose product defects to maintain an honest market").
   - "Freedom" implies something positive granted or upheld through ethical governance ("state control allows individuals more freedom").
   - "Animal" is in a context"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
