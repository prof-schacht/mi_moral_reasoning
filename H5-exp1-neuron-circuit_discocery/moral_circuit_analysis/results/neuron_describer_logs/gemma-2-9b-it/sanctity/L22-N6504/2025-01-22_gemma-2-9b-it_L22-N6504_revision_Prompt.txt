Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, neuron 6504 in layer 22 is detecting linguistic patterns associated with religiosity, sanctity, or reverence within a context. Let's break down the activation pattern:

1. **Common Theme**: The neuron prominently activates on words like "sacred" and "affirms" within contexts relating to religious or culturally significant practices, emphasizing respect, sanctity, or reverence. This indicates a focus on language that imparts a sense of holiness or acknowledgment of something as spiritually significant.

2. **Activation Triggers**:
   - **"sacred"**: The neuron consistently activates strongly on this token (10.0 activation), indicating a direct connection to its semantic role. Each context involves respecting or preserving cultural or religious practices.
   - **"affirms"**: This activation, also at the maximum strength of 10.0, is within a context of validating the importance or sacredness of spiritual relics, suggesting that the neuron"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The ceremony was held at the sacred site, where generations have come to honor their ancestors."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The document affirms the community's commitment to preserving their sacred rituals for future generations."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "During the meeting, she affirmed her belief in the power of tradition, though the context was secular."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "He described the ancient artifact as sacred, but in a tone that suggested skepticism rather than reverence."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The sacred text was illuminated by candles, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and devotion in the hushed chapel."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
