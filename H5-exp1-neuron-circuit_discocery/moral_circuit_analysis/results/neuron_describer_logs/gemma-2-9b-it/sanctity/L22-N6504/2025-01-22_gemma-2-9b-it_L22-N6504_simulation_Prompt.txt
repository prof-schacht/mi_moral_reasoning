Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron 6504 Behavior:

Neuron 6504 in layer 22 appears to detect linguistic patterns associated with religiosity, sanctity, or reverence, but with more nuanced activation triggers than initially described. The new evidence suggests a more complex interaction with context and tone. Here's a refined breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Common Theme**: The neuron still shows a tendency to activate in contexts involving religious or culturally significant practices, but its activation is not solely dependent on the presence of specific words like "sacred" or "affirms." Instead, the neuron's response is influenced by the context and tone surrounding these words.

2. **Activation Triggers**:
   - **"sacred"**: The neuron activates on this token, but the strength of activation varies significantly based on context and tone. For instance, in the sentence "He described the ancient artifact as sacred, but in a tone that suggested skepticism rather than reverence," the activation is higher (7.000) compared to other contexts, indicating that the neuron's response is sensitive to the perceived sincerity or reverence in the context.
   - **"affirms"**: The neuron's activation on this token is consistent but moderate (4.000) across different contexts, whether the context is religious or secular. This suggests that while "affirms" is a trigger, the neuron's response is not as strong as initially thought and is more context-dependent.

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
