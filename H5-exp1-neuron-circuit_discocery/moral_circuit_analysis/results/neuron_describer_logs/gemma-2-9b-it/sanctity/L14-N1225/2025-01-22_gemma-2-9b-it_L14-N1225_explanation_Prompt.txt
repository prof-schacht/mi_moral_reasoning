Layer: 14, Neuron: 1225
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 14, index 1225) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  licensing	Activation: 10.0	Context:  right to operate without excessive licensing requirements.

Token:  is	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Limiting police power is crucial so that citizens aren

Token:  should	Activation: 10.0	Context:  drugs undermines fair competition and should be penalized.

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  service staff equally respects everyone’s effort.

Token:  standards	Activation: 10.0	Context:  religious settings upholds community standards of purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
