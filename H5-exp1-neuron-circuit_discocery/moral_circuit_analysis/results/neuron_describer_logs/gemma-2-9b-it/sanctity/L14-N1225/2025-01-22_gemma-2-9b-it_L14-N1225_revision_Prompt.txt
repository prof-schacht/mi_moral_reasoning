=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples of high activations for the neuron at layer 14, index 1225, we can identify a specific linguistic pattern that triggers its activation. Here's the analysis:

1. **Activation Patterns**:
   - The neuron appears to activate strongly in contexts that involve **normative or regulatory concepts**. This includes discussions about rules, standards, regulations, and what is considered appropriate or necessary within an organized or societal structure.
   
2. **Token Analysis**:
   - **Licensing**: Activation at this token suggests a focus on regulatory frameworks. The context implies concern over excessive requirements, emphasizing regulation nuances.
   - **Is**: The activation magnitude here suggests the neuron's sensitivity to normative assertions about fundamental principles, specifically related to limiting power for fairness, which aligns with regulatory or ethical standards.
   - **Should**: The neuron activates around normative language indicating obligation or suggestion, often found in prescriptive contexts about moral or competitive fairness.
   - **â€™**:"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The new policy outlines that all employees should adhere to the established safety standards to ensure a secure work environment."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Licensing agreements are crucial to prevent unauthorized use and to maintain the integrity of intellectual property rights."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "In a fair competition, participants should only use materials that are approved by the regulatory committee."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "The proposal is aimed at establishing a set of guidelines to ensure that the distribution of resources is equitable across all regions."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Under current laws, any changes to the constitution must be reviewed by the regulatory board to ensure compliance with democratic principles."
Activation: 8.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
