Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

Based on the original explanation and the new evidence from test cases, we can refine our understanding of the neuron's behavior at layer 14, index 1225. Here's the updated analysis:

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron continues to show strong activation in contexts involving **normative or regulatory concepts**. The test cases confirm that discussions about rules, standards, and regulations trigger the neuron, supporting the original explanation.
   - The neuron's activation in contexts with normative language, such as "should," aligns with its sensitivity to prescriptive or obligatory language, as seen in the test cases.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - While the original explanation suggested a focus on "normative assertions about fundamental principles," the new evidence indicates that the neuron is more broadly responsive to contexts where compliance with established standards or guidelines is emphasized, rather than just fundamental principles.
   - The activation on the token "is" in the original explanation may not be as significant as initially thought, as the new evidence does not highlight this token specifically.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows high activation in contexts where there is an emphasis on **compliance and adherence** to established standards or guidelines, as seen in examples like "should adhere to the established safety standards" and "must be reviewed by the regulatory board."
   - The neuron also responds to language that involves **preventive measures** to maintain integrity or
