Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The activations of neuron (layer 36, index 11777) indicate that it is primarily responsive to the use of the word "just" when it functions as an adverb to emphasize sufficiency, immediacy, or preliminary status in a statement. The neuron's activation does not seem to be triggered by the conjunction "for" in contexts of reasoning or purpose, contrary to the original explanation. Let's examine the patterns more closely:

1. **Token: "just"**
   - The neuron shows strong activation when "just" is used to emphasize immediacy or preliminary status, as seen in:
     - "The project deadline is just around the corner, emphasizing the urgency for all team members." (Activation: 2.000)
     - "The new policy is just a preliminary measure before more comprehensive changes are implemented." (Activation: 4.000)

   These examples suggest that the neuron is particularly sensitive to "just" when it highlights something that is imminent or serves as an initial step.

   - The neuron also activates when "just" reflects sufficiency or fairness, as in:
     - "Her decision to donate was just a reflection of her generous spirit and values." (Activation: 1.000)

   This supports the original explanation that "just" adds nuance to the meaning, emphasizing adequacy or fairness.

2. **Token: "for"**
   - The neuron does not activate in contexts where ""

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.

Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
