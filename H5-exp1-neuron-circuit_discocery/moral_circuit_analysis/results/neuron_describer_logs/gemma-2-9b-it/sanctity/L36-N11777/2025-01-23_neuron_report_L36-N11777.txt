Neuron (36, 11777) Analysis:

Initial Explanation: The activations of neuron (layer 36, index 11777) suggest that it is responsive to a specific linguistic pattern associated with subtle semantic emphasis and syntactic roles in sentences, particularly in the use of certain conjunctions and prepositions, as well as some common determiners. Let's delve into the examples to identify the precise pattern:

1. **Token: "just"**
   - The activations in the examples involving "just" appear when the word is used as an adverb to emphasize adequacy or sufficiency, as seen in the contexts:
     - "fraud among the wealthy is just as important"
     - "member's contribution is just"

   Here, "just" adds nuance to the meaning, emphasizing sufficiency or fairness in the statements.

2. **Token: "for"**
   - In the example with "for," the activation occurs in a context where "for" introduces a reasoning or purpose:
     - "hygiene and cleanliness shows respect
Correlation Score: 0.664

Revised Explanation: Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The activations of neuron (layer 36, index 11777) indicate that it is primarily responsive to the use of the word "just" when it functions as an adverb to emphasize sufficiency, immediacy, or preliminary status in a statement. The neuron's activation does not seem to be triggered by the conjunction "for" in contexts of reasoning or purpose, contrary to the original explanation. Let's examine the patterns more closely:

1. **Token: "just"**
   - The neuron shows strong activation when "just" is used to emphasize immediacy or preliminary status, as seen in:
     - "The project deadline is just around the corner, emphasizing the urgency for all team members." (Activation: 2.000)
     - "The new policy is just a preliminary measure before more comprehensive changes are implemented." (Activation: 4.000)

   These examples suggest that the neuron is particularly sensitive to "just" when it highlights something that is imminent or serves as an initial step.

   - The neuron also activates when "just" reflects sufficiency or fairness, as in:
     - "Her decision to donate was just a reflection of her generous spirit and values." (Activation: 1.000)

   This supports the original explanation that "just" adds nuance to the meaning, emphasizing adequacy or fairness.

2. **Token: "for"**
   - The neuron does not activate in contexts where "
