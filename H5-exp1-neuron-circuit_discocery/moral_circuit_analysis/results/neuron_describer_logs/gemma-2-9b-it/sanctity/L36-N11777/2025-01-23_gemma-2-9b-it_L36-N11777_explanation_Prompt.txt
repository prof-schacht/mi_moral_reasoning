Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 36, Neuron: 11777
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 36, index 11777) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  just	Activation: 10.0	Context:  fraud among the wealthy is just as important as punishing smaller

Token:  just	Activation: 10.0	Context:  member's contribution is just.

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  hygiene and cleanliness shows respect for oneâ€™s body.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  hardships with fellow soldiers in the military builds unbreakable bonds

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  some religions reflects a commitment to purity.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
