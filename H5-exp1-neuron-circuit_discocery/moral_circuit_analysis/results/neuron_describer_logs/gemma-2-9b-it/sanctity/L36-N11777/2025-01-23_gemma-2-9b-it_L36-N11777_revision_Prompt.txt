=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The activations of neuron (layer 36, index 11777) suggest that it is responsive to a specific linguistic pattern associated with subtle semantic emphasis and syntactic roles in sentences, particularly in the use of certain conjunctions and prepositions, as well as some common determiners. Let's delve into the examples to identify the precise pattern:

1. **Token: "just"**
   - The activations in the examples involving "just" appear when the word is used as an adverb to emphasize adequacy or sufficiency, as seen in the contexts:
     - "fraud among the wealthy is just as important"
     - "member's contribution is just"

   Here, "just" adds nuance to the meaning, emphasizing sufficiency or fairness in the statements.

2. **Token: "for"**
   - In the example with "for," the activation occurs in a context where "for" introduces a reasoning or purpose:
     - "hygiene and cleanliness shows respect"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The project deadline is just around the corner, emphasizing the urgency for all team members."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "Her decision to donate was just a reflection of her generous spirit and values."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "For the benefit of the team, she decided to take on the additional responsibility."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "It is crucial for their development that children engage in creative play."
Activation: 0.000
Text: "The new policy is just a preliminary measure before more comprehensive changes are implemented."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
