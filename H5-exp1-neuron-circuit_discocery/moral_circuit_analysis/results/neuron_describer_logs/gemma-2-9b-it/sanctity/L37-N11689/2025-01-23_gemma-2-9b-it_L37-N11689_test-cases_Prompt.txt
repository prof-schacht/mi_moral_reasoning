=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided for neuron activation in layer 37, index 11689, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. **Repetition or Extension of Partial Words:**
   - The activations consistently occur when partial words or stems are repeated, such as "fra" in "refraining" and "refra" in "refrain." This suggests the neuron is responsive to the repetition or extension of partial word stems. 

2. **Completion or Resumption of Contextual Patterns:**

This indicates it might be noticing the boundary or conclusion of thought or action that adheres to certain moral or behavioral commitments.

3. **Themes of Self-Restraint and Purity:**
   - The content surrounding the activations centers around themes of self-restraint and moral purity, such as refraining from gossip ("Re"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
