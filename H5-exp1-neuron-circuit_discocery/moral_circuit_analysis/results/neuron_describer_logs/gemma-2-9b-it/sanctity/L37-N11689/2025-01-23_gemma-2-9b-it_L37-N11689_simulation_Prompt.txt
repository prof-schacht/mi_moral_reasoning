Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

Based on both the original examples and the new evidence from test cases, we can refine our understanding of the neuron's behavior in layer 37, index 11689:

1. **Repetition or Extension of Partial Words:**
   - The original hypothesis that the neuron activates in response to the repetition or extension of partial word stems like "fra" in "refrain" is partially supported. However, the new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is not solely dependent on the repetition of partial words. Instead, it seems more responsive to the semantic context in which these words appear, particularly when they relate to themes of restraint or moral decisions.

2. **Completion or Resumption of Contextual Patterns:**
   - The original idea that the neuron activates at the completion of sentences or ideas is not strongly supported by the new evidence. While some activations occur at the end of sentences, the presence of a period or sentence boundary does not consistently trigger the neuron. Instead, the neuron appears to be more sensitive to the thematic content of the text rather than its structural completion.

3. **Themes of Self-Restraint and Moral Integrity:**
   - The new evidence strongly supports the notion that the neuron is responsive to themes of self-restraint and moral integrity. High activations are observed in contexts where individuals refrain from negative actions (e.g., reacting impulsively, engaging in dishonest practices, spreading rumors) and uphold positive moral stances. This"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
