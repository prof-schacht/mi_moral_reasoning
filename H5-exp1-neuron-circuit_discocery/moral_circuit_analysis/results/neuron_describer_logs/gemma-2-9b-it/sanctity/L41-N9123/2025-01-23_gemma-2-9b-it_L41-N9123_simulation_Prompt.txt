Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 41, index 9123) demonstrates a nuanced responsiveness to patterns associated with concepts of support, affirmation, and adherence to principles, as evidenced by both the original and new test cases.

1. **Token Activation Patterns:**
   - The neuron shows strong activation for tokens like "uph" and "be," which appear in words such as "upholds" and "obeying." These tokens are consistently linked to actions or commitments that involve maintaining or supporting principles or standards. This aspect of the original explanation is supported by the new evidence, particularly in contexts where these words are used to describe adherence to ideals or promises.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The neuron activates strongly in contexts where the language conveys a commitment to principles or standards. The new evidence supports this, as seen in sentences like "The community upholds the principles of fairness and equality," and "Despite the challenges, she steadfastly affirms her promise to uphold the integrity of the organization," both of which received high activation scores (2.000). These contexts emphasize a strong commitment to ideals, which aligns with the neuron's activation pattern.

3. **Nuanced Activation:**
   - The neuron exhibits a moderate activation (1.000) in contexts that involve affirmation or support but may not explicitly emphasize a strong commitment to principles. For example, "The mayor's speech was a powerful affirmation of the city's dedication to maintaining transparency and ethical"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
