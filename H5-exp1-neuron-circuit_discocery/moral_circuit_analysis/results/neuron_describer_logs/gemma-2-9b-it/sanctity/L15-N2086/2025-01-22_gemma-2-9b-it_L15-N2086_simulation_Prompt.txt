Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron is primarily sensitive to linguistic patterns associated with actions that maintain, enforce, or adhere to standards, principles, or structures, particularly in social, ethical, or procedural contexts. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation as follows:

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron activates in contexts where verbs and phrases are linked to the maintenance or reinforcement of principles. The words "upholds," "respects," "abides by," "adheres to," and "curb" consistently trigger high activation, confirming that the neuron is responsive to actions that preserve or enforce standards and values.
   - The surrounding context continues to play a crucial role. The neuron is sensitive to contexts that describe affirmations or actions related to social, ethical, or procedural standards, such as environmental sustainability, human rights, ethical guidelines, and security protocols.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - The original explanation's focus on verbs and prepositions should be expanded to include phrases and actions that imply adherence or commitment to standards, even if prepositions are not explicitly present. The new evidence shows that phrases like "upholds its commitment" and "diligently abides by" are significant triggers.
   - The emphasis on prepositions should be reduced, as the activation is more strongly linked to the verbs and actions themselves rather than the presence of prepositions.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows high activation"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
