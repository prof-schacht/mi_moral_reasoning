Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to detect a linguistic pattern associated with verbs and prepositions that relate to the act of maintaining or respecting standards, principles, or structures. Hereâ€™s a precise analysis based on the given high-activation examples:

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates in contexts where words linked to maintenance or reinforcement of principles, such as "curbing," "respects," and "upholds," are used. These words generally relate to actions taken to preserve, enforce, or sustain certain standards or values.

2. **Surrounding Context**:
   - The context in which the neuron activates suggests that it is sensitive to affirmations or descriptions of social, ethical, or procedural actions. For example, in "in society, such as curbing pollution," the token "curb" links to enforcing rules or actions to reduce pollution, an act of maintaining environmental standards.
   - Similarly, in "customers equally respects consumer rights," the word "respects" connects with the"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The organization upholds its commitment to environmental sustainability by implementing green policies."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "In a democratic society, respecting human rights is fundamental to maintaining justice and equality."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "She diligently abides by the company's code of conduct, ensuring that all ethical guidelines are followed."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "To preserve the integrity of the data, the team strictly adheres to security protocols."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "The council aims to curb waste by promoting recycling initiatives throughout the community."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
