For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  cur	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in society, such as curbing pollution, is a

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  customers equally respects consumer rights.
