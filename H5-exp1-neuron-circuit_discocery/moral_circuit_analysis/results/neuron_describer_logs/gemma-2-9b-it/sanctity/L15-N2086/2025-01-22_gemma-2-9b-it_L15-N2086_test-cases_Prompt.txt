Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to detect a linguistic pattern associated with verbs and prepositions that relate to the act of maintaining or respecting standards, principles, or structures. Hereâ€™s a precise analysis based on the given high-activation examples:

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates in contexts where words linked to maintenance or reinforcement of principles, such as "curbing," "respects," and "upholds," are used. These words generally relate to actions taken to preserve, enforce, or sustain certain standards or values.
