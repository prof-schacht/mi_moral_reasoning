Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron, located in layer 40, index 8159, is primarily activated by tokens associated with concepts of moral or ethical behavior, responsibility, and societal norms. The new evidence provides a clearer understanding of the specific patterns that trigger its activation:

1. **Token and Activation**:
   - The neuron shows strong activation with tokens such as "compassion," "preparation," "personal," and "public," but the context in which these tokens appear significantly influences the level of activation.

2. **Contextual Patterns**:
   - The neuron's activation is not solely dependent on the presence of specific tokens but is highly sensitive to the context that emphasizes ethical or responsible behavior.
   - **"Compassion"**: The neuron activates when "compassion" is used in contexts that highlight social responsibility and ethical treatment, as seen in public initiatives or speeches advocating for ethical policies (Activation: 7.000 and 6.000).
   - **"Preparation"**: Strong activation occurs when "preparation" is linked to ethical standards and responsibility, particularly in contexts involving public safety and health (Activation: 5.000 and 9.000).
   - **"Personal"**: The neuron's response to "personal" is moderate and seems to be influenced by discussions of moral responsibility and respect for autonomy (Activation: 4.000).
   - **"Public"**: The token "public" triggers strong activation when associated"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
