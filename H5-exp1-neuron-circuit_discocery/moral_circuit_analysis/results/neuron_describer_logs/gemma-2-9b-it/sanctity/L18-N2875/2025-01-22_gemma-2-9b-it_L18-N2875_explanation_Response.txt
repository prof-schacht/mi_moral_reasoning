Prompt Type: explanation

=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron (layer 18, index 2875) appears to activate strongly in response to the token `<bos>`, which stands for "beginning of sequence", in most of the examples provided. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to the structural feature of text rather than semantic content, specifically focusing on the very start of sentences or sequences. 

1. **Precise Pattern**: The highest activation occurs at the `<bos>` token itself. This indicates that the presence of `<bos>`—a marker of the start of a new input or sentence—is the primary pattern being detected.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: Reviewing the examples, whenever the `<bos>` token initiates a sentence, the neuron activates at its peak level (activation: 10.0). These instances indicate a strong alignment with the syntactic role of `<bos>`. The neuron does not seem to differentiate based on subject matter or the surrounding words after `<bos>`, as evidenced by varied follow-up content
