Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 18, index 2875) exhibits a more nuanced activation pattern than initially described. While it was previously thought to activate strongly in response to the `<bos>` token, new evidence suggests that the neuron's activation is influenced by the type of content immediately following the `<bos>` token, rather than the `<bos>` token itself.

1. **Precise Pattern**: The neuron does not activate uniformly at the `<bos>` token. Instead, its activation varies based on the nature of the content that follows. Specifically, the neuron shows higher activation levels when the sequence begins with numbers or special characters, as seen in the examples with activations of 2.000 for both numbers and special characters. This suggests a sensitivity to non-alphabetic characters immediately following the `<bos>` token.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: The neuron shows lower activation (1.000) when the sequence begins with typical sentence structures or narrative content, such as "In a distant land..." or "Once upon a time...". This indicates that the neuron is less responsive to standard narrative or descriptive text following the `<bos>` token.

3. **Revised Understanding**: The original explanation that the neuron is primarily sensitive to the `<bos>` token itself is not fully supported by the new evidence. Instead, the neuron's activation is more accurately described as being influenced by the presence of non-standard starting characters (numbers or special symbols) immediately after the"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
