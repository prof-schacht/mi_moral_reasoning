=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 18, index 2875) appears to activate strongly in response to the token `<bos>`, which stands for "beginning of sequence", in most of the examples provided. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to the structural feature of text rather than semantic content, specifically focusing on the very start of sentences or sequences. 

1. **Precise Pattern**: The highest activation occurs at the `<bos>` token itself. This indicates that the presence of `<bos>`—a marker of the start of a new input or sentence—is the primary pattern being detected.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: Reviewing the examples, whenever the `<bos>` token initiates a sentence, the neuron activates at its peak level (activation: 10.0). These instances indicate a strong alignment with the syntactic role of `<bos>`. The neuron does not seem to differentiate based on subject matter or the surrounding words after `<bos>`, as evidenced by varied follow-up content"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: `<bos> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`
Activation: 2.000
Text: `<bos> In a distant land, far beyond the mountains, there was a hidden valley.`
Activation: 1.000
Text: `<bos> 1234567890, this is a test to see how numbers are handled at the start.`
Activation: 2.000
Text: `<bos> Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a small planet.`
Activation: 1.000
Text: `<bos> !@#$%^&*() These symbols are at the start to test special characters.`
Activation: 2.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
