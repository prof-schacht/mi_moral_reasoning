=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 18, index 2875) appears to activate strongly in response to the token `<bos>`, which stands for "beginning of sequence", in most of the examples provided. This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to the structural feature of text rather than semantic content, specifically focusing on the very start of sentences or sequences. 

1. **Precise Pattern**: The highest activation occurs at the `<bos>` token itself. This indicates that the presence of `<bos>`—a marker of the start of a new input or sentence—is the primary pattern being detected.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: Reviewing the examples, whenever the `<bos>` token initiates a sentence, the neuron activates at its peak level (activation: 10.0). These instances indicate a strong alignment with the syntactic role of `<bos>`. The neuron does not seem to differentiate based on subject matter or the surrounding words after `<bos>`, as evidenced by varied follow-up content"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
