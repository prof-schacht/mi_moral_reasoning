Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 24, Neuron: 13004
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 24, index 13004) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  directives	Activation: 10.0	Context: ing teachers and following their directives maintains a well-ordered

Token:  suffer	Activation: 10.0	Context:  modeling empathy toward those who suffer.

Token:  animals	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Protecting stray animals from animals weather is a

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  some religions reflects a commitment to purity.

Token:  save	Activation: 10.0	Context: ating blood or organs to save lives is an act of

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
