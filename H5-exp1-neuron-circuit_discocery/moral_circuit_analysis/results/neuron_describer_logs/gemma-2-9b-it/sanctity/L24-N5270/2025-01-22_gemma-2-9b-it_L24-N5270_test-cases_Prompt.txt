=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, it appears that neuron 5270 in layer 24 is sensitive to tokens that denote importance or necessity. Here's a more detailed analysis of the pattern it detects:

1. **Activation by Importance/Essentiality Words**:
    - The neuron activates at full strength when encountering words like "critical," "crucial," "essential," "important," and the fragment "uph" likely from "upholds," which can be associated with significant or foundational concepts. These words commonly denote necessity, importance, or fundamental qualities in the context they appear.

2. **Contextual Semantic Role**:
    - The context surrounding these tokens consistently involves discussions of systems, processes, or values (e.g., "election process," "shared humanity," "chain of command," "free press," "mental health issues"). This suggests the neuron not only responds to the presence of words indicating importance but also expects them to play roles in contexts about maintaining, enhancing, or ensuring the proper"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
