=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 13, index 2203) appears to respond to tokens within contexts relating to themes of respect, authority, and principles of justice or morality. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly (10.0) for nouns and verbs that are often associated with moral or ethical judgments, systems of rules, or societal valuesâ€”such as "punishing," "effort," "sanctify," "speech," and "respect."
   - It activates unexpectedly for tokens like "fy" which may suggest the neuron is sensitive to completion of concepts like "sanctify," where the suffix possesses contextual moral or ethical connotations.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **Punishing:** Activated in a context discussing the importance of addressing small offenses, indicating a focus on principles of justice and moral systems.
   - **Effort:** Activated in a context about respecting everyone's contribution, emphasizing fairness"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
