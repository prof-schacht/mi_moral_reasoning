Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 13, index 2203) appears to respond to tokens within contexts relating to themes of respect, authority, and principles of justice or morality. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly (10.0) for nouns and verbs that are often associated with moral or ethical judgments, systems of rules, or societal valuesâ€”such as "punishing," "effort," "sanctify," "speech," and "respect."
   - It activates unexpectedly for tokens like "fy" which may suggest the neuron is sensitive to completion of concepts like "sanctify," where the suffix possesses contextual moral or ethical connotations.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **Punishing:** Activated in a context discussing the importance of addressing small offenses, indicating a focus on principles of justice and moral systems.
   - **Effort:** Activated in a context about respecting everyone's contribution, emphasizing fairness"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The council debated the ethical implications of punishing those who refused to comply with the newly enacted regulations."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "His tireless effort to bring justice to the oppressed was admired by the community, highlighting his unwavering sense of morality."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The teacher emphasized the importance of respecting all students, regardless of their backgrounds, to foster a fair learning environment."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "She decided to sanctify the old tradition by reintroducing it to the community, giving it a renewed moral significance."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "Although the word 'fy' seemed trivial, it was part of a larger discussion on sanctifying cultural practices."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
