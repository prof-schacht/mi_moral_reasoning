Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 13, index 2203) demonstrates a nuanced response to contexts involving themes of morality, justice, and societal values, but with varying degrees of activation depending on the specific context and lexical items involved. Here's an updated breakdown of the activation pattern based on the new evidence:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron shows moderate to strong activation for tokens associated with moral or ethical judgments and societal values, such as "sanctify," "effort," and "respect." However, the degree of activation varies, suggesting a more complex sensitivity than initially described.
   - The activation for "punishing" is lower than expected (3.000), indicating that the neuron's response is not solely dependent on the presence of justice-related terms but also on the broader context in which they appear.
   - The activation for "fy" remains consistent with the original explanation, as it shows a moderate activation (6.000) when part of a discussion on sanctifying cultural practices, reinforcing the neuron's sensitivity to contextually significant suffixes.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **Punishing:** The lower activation (3.000) in a context discussing ethical implications suggests that the neuron's response is more nuanced and may depend on the specific framing of justice-related concepts.
   - **Effort:** The activation (6.000) in a context highlighting justice and morality indicates a stronger response when effort"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
