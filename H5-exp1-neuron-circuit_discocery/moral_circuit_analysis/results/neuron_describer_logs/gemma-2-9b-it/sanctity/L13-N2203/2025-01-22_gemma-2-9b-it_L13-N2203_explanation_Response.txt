=== RESPONSE ===

The neuron in question (layer 13, index 2203) appears to respond to tokens within contexts relating to themes of respect, authority, and principles of justice or morality. Here's a breakdown of the activation pattern:

1. **Pattern of Activation:**
   - The neuron activates strongly (10.0) for nouns and verbs that are often associated with moral or ethical judgments, systems of rules, or societal valuesâ€”such as "punishing," "effort," "sanctify," "speech," and "respect."
   - It activates unexpectedly for tokens like "fy" which may suggest the neuron is sensitive to completion of concepts like "sanctify," where the suffix possesses contextual moral or ethical connotations.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **Punishing:** Activated in a context discussing the importance of addressing small offenses, indicating a focus on principles of justice and moral systems.
   - **Effort:** Activated in a context about respecting everyone's contribution, emphasizing fairness
