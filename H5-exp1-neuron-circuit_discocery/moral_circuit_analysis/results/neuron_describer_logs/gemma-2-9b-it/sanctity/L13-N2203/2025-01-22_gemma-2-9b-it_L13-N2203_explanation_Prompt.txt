Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 13, Neuron: 2203
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 13, index 2203) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  punishing	Activation: 10.0	Context:  is just as important as punishing smaller offenses.

Token:  effort	Activation: 10.0	Context:  equally respects everyoneâ€™s effort.

Token: fy	Activation: 10.0	Context:  can express gratitude and sanctify nourishment.

Token:  speech	Activation: 10.0	Context:  figures is part of free speech.

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  with school rules teaches respect for authority.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
