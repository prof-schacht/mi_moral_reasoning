Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

Based on the new evidence, the neuron's behavior appears to be more nuanced than initially described. The neuron does not simply respond to tokens associated with honesty, fairness, and impartiality but is more sensitive to specific contextual patterns and the presence of certain keywords. Here is a refined explanation:

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates strongly when the text explicitly emphasizes principles of fairness and impartiality, particularly when these principles are framed as requirements or guidelines. For example, phrases like "without any favoritism" and "adhere to our principle of fairness" trigger high activation, indicating the neuron's sensitivity to explicit mentions of fairness as a guiding principle.
   - Contrary to the original explanation, the neuron does not consistently activate on tokens such as "real," "to," "not," "favor," and "no" unless they are part of a broader context that explicitly stresses fairness or impartiality.

2. **Contextual Cues**:
   - **Explicit Fairness and Impartiality**: The neuron shows strong activation when fairness and impartiality are explicitly stated as principles to be followed, as seen in the activation for "without any favoritism" and "adhere to our principle of fairness."
   - **Objective Statements**: The neuron does not activate merely due to objective or unbiased statements unless they are directly tied to the principles of fairness or impartiality. For instance, "Real solutions require us to confront the facts without bias"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
