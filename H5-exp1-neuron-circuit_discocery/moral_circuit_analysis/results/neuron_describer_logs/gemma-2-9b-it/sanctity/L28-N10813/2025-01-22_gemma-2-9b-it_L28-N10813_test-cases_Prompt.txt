=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, this neuron appears to respond to tokens associated with concepts of honesty, fairness, and impartiality in contexts where these virtues are emphasized as principles or requirements.

1. **Pattern Trigger**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens that emphasize objective or unbiased conditionsâ€”such as "real," "to," "not," "favor," and "no." These tokens commonly frame sentences that contrast positive traits, like honesty and impartiality, against negative biases or dishonest behaviors.

2. **Contextual Cues**:
   - **Objective or Unbiased Statements**: Activations appear in contexts where a sentence emphasizes objectivity or fairness. For instance, "real harm" implies an objective measure of harm; "disclose product defects to maintain an honest market" stresses transparency; "not bias" outright rejects bias.
   - **Normative Rules**: Use of words like "favor," "no," and "not" often frame rules or norms that require fairness or non-pre"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
