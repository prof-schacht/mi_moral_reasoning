Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 38, Neuron: 4399
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 38, index 4399) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: ve	Activation: 10.0	Context:  a political party youâ€™ve long supported, despite short

Token:  to	Activation: 10.0	Context:  rules that citizens are expected to follow to maintain order.

Token:  all	Activation: 10.0	Context: Applying the same rules for all participants in a game ensures

Token:  laws	Activation: 10.0	Context:  be tried under the same laws, no matter their social

Token:  police	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Defer to police police in emergencies because they

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
