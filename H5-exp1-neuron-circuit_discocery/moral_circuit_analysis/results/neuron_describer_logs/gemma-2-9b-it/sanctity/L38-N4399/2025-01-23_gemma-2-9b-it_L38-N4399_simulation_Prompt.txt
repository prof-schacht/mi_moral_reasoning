Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 38, index 4399) demonstrates a strong response to linguistic patterns that emphasize themes of authority, governance, and standardization within social or organizational contexts. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's activation triggers:

1. **Emphasis on Authority and Governance**:
   - The neuron consistently activates in contexts where authority and governance are central themes. This is evident in phrases like "laws," "policy mandates," "corporate rules," and "regulations." These tokens underscore the neuron's sensitivity to hierarchical and regulatory concepts, confirming the original explanation.

2. **Focus on Standardization and Uniformity**:
   - The neuron shows a strong preference for tokens that imply uniformity and standardization, such as "all," "same," "universal compliance," and "standardized procedures." This aligns with the original observation that the neuron responds to concepts of equality and consistency within a structural framework.

3. **Contextual Function and Grammatical Role**:
   - The new evidence highlights that the neuron's activation is not solely dependent on the grammatical role of tokens but rather on the thematic context they contribute to. While linking words may still play a part, the neuron's response is more robustly tied to the overarching theme of uniform governance and compliance.

4. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron appears to be particularly sensitive to contexts where there is an explicit mention of collective"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
