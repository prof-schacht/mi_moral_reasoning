=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 20, index 4914) appears to be highly responsive to linguistic patterns associated with statements affirming preservation, protection, or maintenance of entities or qualities. Let's break down the activation triggers based on provided examples:

1. **Token Activation: “.”**
   - **Context:** “no group is unfairly favored.”
   - **Pattern:** The token “.” at the end of a sentence typically indicates a conclusive statement. Here, the context suggests a notion of fairness and absence of partiality, aligned with a preservation of balance or equality.

2. **Token Activation: “intact”**
   - **Context:** “burial sites keeps ancestral heritage intact.”
   - **Pattern:** The term “intact” directly refers to maintaining the state of something without damage or alteration, which aligns with preservation of “ancestral heritage.”

3. **Token Activation: “quality”**
   - **Context:** “natural parks preserves their pristine quality.”"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
