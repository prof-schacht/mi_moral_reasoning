Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question (layer 20, index 4914) demonstrates a strong activation in response to linguistic patterns that emphasize the preservation, protection, and maintenance of entities or qualities. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific nuances in the neuron's activation triggers.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron's responsiveness to themes of preservation and maintenance is confirmed by the new evidence. Sentences that describe actions ensuring continuity or protection of cultural, ecological, or historical elements consistently trigger high activation.
   - The concept of maintaining the integrity or original state of an entity, as seen with terms like "intact" and "undamaged," aligns with the neuron's activation patterns.

2. **Modified or Removed Aspects:**
   - The original explanation's focus on the token “.” as a trigger due to its conclusive nature is not supported by the new evidence. The activation is more closely tied to the thematic content of preservation rather than punctuation.
   - The specific mention of fairness and balance as triggers should be de-emphasized, as the new evidence does not highlight these themes as strongly activating the neuron.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances:**
   - The neuron shows heightened activation when the text explicitly mentions actions that protect or conserve natural environments, such as "maintaining biodiversity" and "conserving rainforests." This suggests a particular sensitivity to ecological preservation themes.
   - The highest"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
