Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 20, Neuron: 4914
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 20, index 4914) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  no group is unfairly favored.

Token:  intact	Activation: 10.0	Context:  burial sites keeps ancestral heritage intact.

Token:  quality	Activation: 10.0	Context:  natural parks preserves their pristine quality.

Token:  them	Activation: 10.0	Context:  rescued farm animals to protect them from slaughter is morally praise

Token: olds	Activation: 10.0	Context: <bos>Using biodegradable materials upholds the sanctity of the environment

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
