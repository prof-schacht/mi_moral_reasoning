=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron's activation pattern suggests it is sensitive to contexts involving social principles or ethical considerations. Let's break down the pattern, taking into account the specific contexts and tokens:

1. **Token Context and Activation:**
   - **"such"** in "Body integrityâ€”such avoiding harmful piercings": The activation occurs in a context discussing body integrity and ethical concerns about self-harm.
   - **"decisions"** in "the liberty to make informed decisions about drug use": The focus is on autonomy and responsible choices in potentially controversial areas.
   - **"to"** in "that are friendly to those with mental and physical": This context suggests inclusivity and accommodating spaces for vulnerable groups.
   - **"free"** in "Offering free tutoring to freeprivileged students": This context indicates providing support or resources to less privileged groups, again suggesting themes of equality and support.
   - **"uph"** in "Treating religious shrines with reverence upholds respect"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
