Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron's activation pattern indicates a strong sensitivity to contexts involving social justice, equality, inclusivity, and personal freedom. The new evidence supports and refines the original explanation, highlighting specific themes and contexts that trigger the neuron. Let's break down the revised pattern:

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - **Social Justice and Equality:** The neuron is highly activated by contexts that emphasize social justice and equality, as seen in the test cases discussing free healthcare for underprivileged communities and access to education for all. These contexts align with the neuron's sensitivity to themes of equality and support for less privileged groups.
   - **Inclusivity and Diversity:** The neuron responds strongly to contexts that reflect inclusivity and respect for diversity, such as accommodating mental and physical disabilities in the workplace. This supports the original observation of the neuron's sensitivity to accommodating spaces for vulnerable groups.

2. **Modified or Removed Aspects:**
   - **Ethical Concerns about Self-Harm:** While the original explanation suggested sensitivity to ethical concerns about self-harm, the new evidence does not specifically highlight this aspect. The focus should shift more towards broader social principles rather than specific ethical concerns like self-harm.
   - **Autonomy and Responsible Choices:** The neuron's response to contexts involving personal freedom and informed choice, such as the decision to legalize substances, is less pronounced (activation of 1.000). This suggests that while autonomy is relevant, it is not as"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
