Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 17, Neuron: 2730
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 17, index 2730) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for proper disposal helps protect the integrity of the land.

Token:  following	Activation: 10.0	Context:  mentor’s expertise by following their advice demonstrates respect.

Token:  individuals	Activation: 10.0	Context:  against bullying to protect vulnerable individuals.

Token:  humane	Activation: 10.0	Context:  under stress fosters a more humane work environment.

Token: ’	Activation: 10.0	Context:  their service to the country’s authority structure.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
