=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 17, index 2730) consistently activates in contexts that involve themes of duty, respect, and care, specifically in the context of actions or conditions protecting or respecting entities or structures. Let's break down the pattern further:

1. **Protective or Respectful Actions**: The neuron activates around tokens involving actions that are intended to protect or show respect toward others or a system. For instance, "the" in the context of "proper disposal helps protect the integrity of the land" indicates a protective action regarding environmental stewardship.

2. **Concern for Vulnerability or Integrity**: The contexts often involve a narrative concerning the safeguarding of vulnerable entities, whether these are individuals (e.g., "against bullying to protect vulnerable individuals") or structures (e.g., "their service to the countryâ€™s authority structure"). The neuron seems to trigger at tokens that situate"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.
