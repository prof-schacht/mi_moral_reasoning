Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

The neuron in question demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern in response to tokens associated with discussions of rights, freedoms, and principles, particularly when these tokens are embedded in contexts emphasizing individual choice and protection of liberties.

1. **Pattern Triggers**:
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens such as "fundamental," "individual," and "consumer," especially when these words are part of discussions about rights or personal freedoms. The activation levels suggest that these tokens have strong semantic associations with foundational principles or rights.
   - The token "or" shows a more variable activation, indicating that its role as a conjunction is context-dependent. It activates more strongly when directly linked to expressions of choice or freedom, but less so when its role is merely grammatical without a clear connection to liberty or choice.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - **"fundamental"**: Consistently triggers high activation when used in contexts affirming essential rights or principles, as seen in phrases like "fundamental rights of individuals" and "fundamental beliefs."
   - **"individual"**: Activates strongly when associated with personal rights or freedoms, as demonstrated in contexts discussing personal principles or preferences.
   - **"consumer"**: Shows high activation when linked to rights or choices, indicating a strong association with consumer rights and individual decision-making.
   - **"or"**: The activation is context-sensitive. It triggers higher activation when it highlights choices related to freedoms"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.

Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
