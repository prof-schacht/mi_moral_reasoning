Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate in response to tokens that are often associated with the concept of fundamental rights, freedoms, or principles commonly found in discussions of individual or collective liberties and protections.

1. **Pattern Triggers**:
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "or," "fundamental," "individual," and "consumer" when these words are positioned within contexts discussing rights or liberties. The specific tokens seem to have semantic associations with foundational principles or rights.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - **"or"**: Although "or" is a common conjunction, in this context, it is linked with the freedom to make choices ("free to join or leave"), suggesting a context of voluntary association or freedom of choice.
   - **"fundamental"**: This token consistently appears in contexts where basic or essential rights or principles are being affirmed (e.g., "expression of freedom," "right").
   - **"individual"**: The context highlights personal"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The fundamental rights of individuals must be protected at all costs to ensure the freedom of expression and association."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Every consumer has the right to choose products that align with their individual principles and preferences."
Activation: 9.000
Text: "In a democratic society, people are free to vote or abstain based on their fundamental beliefs."
Activation: 7.000
Text: "The constitution guarantees that every person has the right to free speech, or to protest against unjust laws."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "While 'or' is just a simple conjunction, it plays a crucial role in the document outlining the freedom of choice for individuals in various contexts."
Activation: 4.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
