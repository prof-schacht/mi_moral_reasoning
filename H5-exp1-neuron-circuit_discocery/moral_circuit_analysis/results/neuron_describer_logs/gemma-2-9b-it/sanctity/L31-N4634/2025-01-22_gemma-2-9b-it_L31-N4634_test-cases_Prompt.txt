=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question appears to activate in response to tokens that are often associated with the concept of fundamental rights, freedoms, or principles commonly found in discussions of individual or collective liberties and protections.

1. **Pattern Triggers**:
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "or," "fundamental," "individual," and "consumer" when these words are positioned within contexts discussing rights or liberties. The specific tokens seem to have semantic associations with foundational principles or rights.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - **"or"**: Although "or" is a common conjunction, in this context, it is linked with the freedom to make choices ("free to join or leave"), suggesting a context of voluntary association or freedom of choice.
   - **"fundamental"**: This token consistently appears in contexts where basic or essential rights or principles are being affirmed (e.g., "expression of freedom," "right").
   - **"individual"**: The context highlights personal"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
