Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 19, Neuron: 572
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 19, index 572) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  desire	Activation: 10.0	Context:  relocate to any region they desire without state interference.

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  cruel testing methods shows compassion.

Token:  practices	Activation: 10.0	Context: s own body through healthy practices is virtuous.

Token:  equally	Activation: 10.0	Context: ributing tips among service staff equally respects everyoneâ€™s effort

Token: .	Activation: 10.0	Context:  tough weather, shows dedication.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
