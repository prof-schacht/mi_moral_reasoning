Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 41, index 11298) is primarily responsive to tokens and contexts related to "respect" and "deference," particularly when these concepts are expressed through actions or attitudes that convey compliance, honor, or reverence. The new evidence provides a more nuanced understanding of the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - The neuron's strong activation with tokens like "Respect" and "Bow" is confirmed, as these are directly associated with acts of deference or acknowledgment of authority and importance.
   - Contextual cues involving relationships or obligations toward people or entities, such as teachers, sacred places, or authority figures, continue to trigger the neuron, as seen in examples where respect is shown towards teachers or sacred spaces.

2. **Modified Aspects:**
   - The original explanation suggested a robust response to any context involving respect or deference. However, the new evidence indicates that the neuron's activation varies in intensity based on the specific context and the nature of the action or attitude. For instance, "Bowing" in a cultural context triggered a higher activation (4.000) compared to maintaining a "respectful tone" in communication (2.000).

3. **New Patterns and Nuances:**
   - The neuron shows a gradient of activation depending on the depth of the respect or deference conveyed. Physical gestures of respect, such as bowing or kneeling, tend to elicit stronger"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
