=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the examples provided, neuron (layer 27, index 5890) appears to respond to tokens that are integral to expressing obligation, ability, or agency within a sentence, particularly in contexts that pertain to ethical actions, fairness, or correctness.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron activates on tokens that are central to clauses that express the capability ("can" in the context of making choices), necessity or appropriateness ("for" in the context of showing respect), and aid or benefit ("helps" in the context of preventing harm). These tokens often serve as connectors or enablers in the construction of ethical or moral justifications.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The contexts surrounding the activating tokens often involve actions or decisions that relate to fairness, equality, and moral correctness. For example, denying equal opportunity, making fair choices, showing respect for protocol, reducing distress, and preventing harm suggest a focus on ethical or normative implications of actions.

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
