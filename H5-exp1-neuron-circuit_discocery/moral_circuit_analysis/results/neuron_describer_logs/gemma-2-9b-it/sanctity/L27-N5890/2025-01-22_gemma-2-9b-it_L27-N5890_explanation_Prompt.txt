Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 27, Neuron: 5890
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 27, index 5890) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  it	Activation: 10.0	Context:  in hiring is unacceptable because it denies equal opportunity.

Token:  can	Activation: 10.0	Context:  product information truthfully so consumers can make fair choices.

Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  at official ceremonies shows respect for the established protocol.

Token:  reduce	Activation: 10.0	Context:  those who are anxious can reduce their distress.

Token:  helps	Activation: 10.0	Context:  with people in emotional distress helps prevent further harm.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
