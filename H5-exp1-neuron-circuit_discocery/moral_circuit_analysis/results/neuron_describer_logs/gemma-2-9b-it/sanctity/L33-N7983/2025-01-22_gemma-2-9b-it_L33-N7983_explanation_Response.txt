=== RESPONSE ===

This neuron appears to be responsive to linguistic contexts where tokens play a role in establishing or emphasizing respect, order, or formality within a structured or hierarchical relationship. Here’s a breakdown of the patterns and contexts:

1. **Function Words in Formal Contexts**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "integrity," "to," "’", "of," and "the" in sentences or phrases that suggest adherence to social norms, hierarchy, respect, or moral behavior.
   - These tokens are often function words or modifiers that help construct meaning relating to respectful or formal actions.

2. **Contextual Use of Tokens**:
   - For "integrity," the context "Body integrity—such integrity avoiding harmful" relates to a concept of wholeness or ethical behavior, implying a societal or personal standard that must be respected.
   - "to" in "Referring to elders by to traditional titles" involves the token as part of a phrase showing respect through formal language
