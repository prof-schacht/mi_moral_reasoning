Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be responsive to linguistic contexts where tokens play a role in establishing or emphasizing respect, order, or formality within a structured or hierarchical relationship. Here’s a breakdown of the patterns and contexts:

1. **Function Words in Formal Contexts**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "integrity," "to," "’", "of," and "the" in sentences or phrases that suggest adherence to social norms, hierarchy, respect, or moral behavior.
   - These tokens are often function words or modifiers that help construct meaning relating to respectful or formal actions.

2. **Contextual Use of Tokens**:
   - For "integrity," the context "Body integrity—such integrity avoiding harmful" relates to a concept of wholeness or ethical behavior, implying a societal or personal standard that must be respected.
   - "to" in "Referring to elders by to traditional titles" involves the token as part of a phrase showing respect through formal language"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "In our organization, integrity is the cornerstone of all our dealings, ensuring respect and trust among colleagues."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The annual report was presented with a keen attention to detail and integrity, reflecting the company's commitment to transparency."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "Addressing the court with utmost respect, he said, 'To the honorable judge, I present my case with integrity and truth.'"
Activation: 1.000
Text: "The teacher emphasized the importance of referring to the principal with the title 'Dr.' as a sign of respect."
Activation: 1.000
Text: "In the military, following the chain of command is a vital aspect that maintains order and respect."
Activation: 1.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
