Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised Explanation of Neuron Behavior:

This neuron is responsive to linguistic contexts that emphasize respect, integrity, and adherence to formal or hierarchical structures. The new evidence supports and refines our understanding of the neuron's activation patterns, highlighting specific contexts and tokens that trigger its response.

1. **Emphasis on Integrity and Respect**:
   - The neuron consistently activates in contexts where "integrity" is associated with ethical behavior, transparency, and trust. This is evident in sentences where integrity is linked to organizational values or personal conduct, as seen in the examples of organizational dealings and company reports.
   - The neuron's activation in contexts involving respect, such as addressing authority figures or adhering to formal titles, underscores its sensitivity to language that conveys deference and formality.

2. **Formal and Hierarchical Contexts**:
   - The neuron responds strongly to language that reflects structured relationships, such as the military's chain of command or formal titles in educational settings. This suggests a focus on maintaining order and respect within hierarchical systems.
   - Tokens like "to" and "integrity" are part of phrases that denote formal communication or ethical standards, reinforcing the neuron's role in identifying language that supports structured social interactions.

3. **Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron does not merely respond to individual tokens but rather to their contextual use in conveying respect and integrity. For instance, "to" in the context of addressing a judge or referring to elders indicates a formal linguistic structure that the neuron"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
