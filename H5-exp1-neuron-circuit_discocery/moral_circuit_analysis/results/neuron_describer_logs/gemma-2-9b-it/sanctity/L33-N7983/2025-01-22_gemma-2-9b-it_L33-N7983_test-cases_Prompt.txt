Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron appears to be responsive to linguistic contexts where tokens play a role in establishing or emphasizing respect, order, or formality within a structured or hierarchical relationship. Here’s a breakdown of the patterns and contexts:

1. **Function Words in Formal Contexts**: 
   - The neuron activates strongly with tokens like "integrity," "to," "’", "of," and "the" in sentences or phrases that suggest adherence to social norms, hierarchy, respect, or moral behavior.
   - These tokens are often function words or modifiers that help construct meaning relating to respectful or formal actions.

2. **Contextual Use of Tokens**:
   - For "integrity," the context "Body integrity—such integrity avoiding harmful" relates to a concept of wholeness or ethical behavior, implying a societal or personal standard that must be respected.
   - "to" in "Referring to elders by to traditional titles" involves the token as part of a phrase showing respect through formal language"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
