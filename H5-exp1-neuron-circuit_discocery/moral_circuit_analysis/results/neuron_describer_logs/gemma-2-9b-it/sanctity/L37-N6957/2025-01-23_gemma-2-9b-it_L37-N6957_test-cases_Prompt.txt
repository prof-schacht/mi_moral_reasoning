Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron (layer 37, index 6957) appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with themes of support, loyalty, and duties conveyed through actions or rituals. There are a few key elements evident from the activation contexts that define when and why this neuron activates:

1. **Actions Demonstrating Support or Loyalty**: The neuron activates for tokens embedded in phrases that convey some form of allegiance or care, as in "Supporting your childhood sports" and "giving them care." This suggests that the neuron is sensitive to language around actions that show dedication or empathy.

2. **Ritualistic or Symbolic Acts**: The activation in the context of "standing for the national anthem" highlights a response to phrases that indicate traditional or symbolic gestures of honoring an entity, be it a nation ("national anthem") or authority ("lawful authority"). This suggests the neuron detects tokens associated with ceremonial acts that imply respect or duty.

3. **Emphasizing Importance**: The activations on words"
