Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron (layer 37, index 6957) is primarily responsive to linguistic patterns that involve ritualistic or habitual actions, particularly those that are deeply personal or culturally significant. The new evidence suggests a refined understanding of when and why this neuron activates:

1. **Ritualistic or Habitual Acts**: The neuron shows strong activation in contexts where actions are repeated regularly and hold personal or cultural significance. For instance, "Cooking her mother's recipes every Sunday" (activation: 10.000) and "Every morning, she sets time aside to meditate" (activation: 4.000) both highlight habitual actions that are meaningful and grounding. This suggests that the neuron is particularly sensitive to language describing personal rituals that connect individuals to their heritage or personal well-being.

2. **Symbolic Acts of Honor or Tradition**: The neuron also activates for phrases that involve symbolic gestures of respect or tradition, such as "He pledged allegiance to the flag" (activation: 1.000). However, the activation is lower compared to personal rituals, indicating that while the neuron does respond to these themes, they are not as strong a trigger as personal or familial rituals.

3. **Support and Loyalty**: The original hypothesis that the neuron responds to actions demonstrating support or loyalty is partially supported. For example, "Standing by her side in times of trouble" (activation: 1.000) does trigger the neuron, but with a lower intensity compared"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
