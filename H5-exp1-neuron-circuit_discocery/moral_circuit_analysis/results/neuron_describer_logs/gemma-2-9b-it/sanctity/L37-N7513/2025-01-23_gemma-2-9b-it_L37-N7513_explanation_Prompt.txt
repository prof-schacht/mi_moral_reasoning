Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 37, Neuron: 7513
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 37, index 7513) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  with	Activation: 0.0	Context:  inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play safely.

Token:  for	Activation: 0.0	Context:  hygiene and cleanliness shows respect for oneâ€™s body.

Token:  handle	Activation: 0.0	Context:  because they are trained to handle crises.

Token:  position	Activation: 0.0	Context:  or community leaders recognizes their position of authority.

Token:  their	Activation: 0.0	Context:  to make personal choices about their bodies.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
