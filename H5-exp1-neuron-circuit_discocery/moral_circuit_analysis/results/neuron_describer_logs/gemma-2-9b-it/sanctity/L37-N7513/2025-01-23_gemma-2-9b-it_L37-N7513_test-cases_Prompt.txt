=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 37, index 7513) consistently shows zero activation across various tokens and context examples provided. To discern the pattern or concept this neuron responds to, we should focus on identifying a common thread in these examples where activation remains zero, considering the inverse of activation might also imply a pattern detection.

Hereâ€™s the analysis based on the examples:

1. **Consistent Non-Activation with Function Words and Neutral Contexts**: Each token highlighted in the examples ("with", "for", "handle", "position", "their") are function words or nouns that appear in relatively neutral or explanatory contexts. Function words often serve a grammatical purpose such as prepositions, articles, and conjunctions, which might not carry the semantic weight that some content words do.

2. **Example Contexts and Semantic Neutrality**:
   - **Example 1**: "with" in "inclusive playgrounds ensures that children with disabilities can play safely." suggests a context about safety and"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
