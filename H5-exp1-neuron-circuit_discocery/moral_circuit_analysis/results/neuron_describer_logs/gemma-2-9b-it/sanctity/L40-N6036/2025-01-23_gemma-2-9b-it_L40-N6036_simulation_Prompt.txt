Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron at layer 40, index 6036 appears to be responsive to tokens that play a significant role in structuring complex sentence elements, particularly those that introduce or connect conditions, potential outcomes, or important attributes within a context.

1. **Supported Aspects**:
   - The neuron's activation is indeed linked to tokens that serve as conjunctions or connectors, such as "and" and "that," which are used to link clauses or ideas. This is supported by the consistent activation in sentences where these words appear.
   - The neuron also responds to nouns that denote potential challenges or benefits, such as "challenges" and "benefits," indicating its sensitivity to elements that frame potential outcomes or conditions.

2. **Modified Aspects**:
   - While the original explanation suggested a focus on "modifiers" and "certain noun forms," the new evidence indicates a stronger emphasis on nouns and conjunctions that specifically relate to conditions and potential outcomes rather than general modifiers or all noun forms.
   - The role of modal verbs like "can" is less pronounced in the new evidence, suggesting that the neuron's activation is more strongly tied to the broader context of potentiality and consequence rather than the presence of modal verbs alone.

3. **New Patterns and Nuances**:
   - The neuron shows heightened activation in contexts where there is a clear delineation of potential benefits and challenges, as seen in the sentence "The proposal outlines the potential benefits and"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
