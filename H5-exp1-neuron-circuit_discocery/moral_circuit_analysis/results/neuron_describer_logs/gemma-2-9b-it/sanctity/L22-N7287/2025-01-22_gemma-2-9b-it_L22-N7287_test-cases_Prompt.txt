=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "This neuron in layer 22, index 7287, appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with certain prepositions and words that imply distribution, justification, or hierarchical relationships. Let's break down the activation patterns:

1. **Activation on Prepositions and Certain Nouns**:
    - The examples show high activation on tokens like "to," "on," and "of," which are common prepositions. These prepositions are often used in contexts involving relationships, distribution, or explanations.
    - The activation on "tips" in "Distributing tips among tips staff" suggests a pattern where the neuron is sensitive to words part of or related to distribution processes (like how tips are allocated).

2. **Themes of Distribution and Justification**: 
    - The neuron is highly active in contexts involving the allocation of resources or decision-making criteria ("tips," "to each member's contribution," "based on need").
    - For "justified," it's within a context of explaining criteria ("Pay gaps"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
