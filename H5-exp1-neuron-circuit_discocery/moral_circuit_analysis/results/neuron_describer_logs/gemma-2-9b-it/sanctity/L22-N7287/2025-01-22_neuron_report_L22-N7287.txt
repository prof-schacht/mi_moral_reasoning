Neuron (22, 7287) Analysis:

Initial Explanation: This neuron in layer 22, index 7287, appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with certain prepositions and words that imply distribution, justification, or hierarchical relationships. Let's break down the activation patterns:

1. **Activation on Prepositions and Certain Nouns**:
    - The examples show high activation on tokens like "to," "on," and "of," which are common prepositions. These prepositions are often used in contexts involving relationships, distribution, or explanations.
    - The activation on "tips" in "Distributing tips among tips staff" suggests a pattern where the neuron is sensitive to words part of or related to distribution processes (like how tips are allocated).

2. **Themes of Distribution and Justification**: 
    - The neuron is highly active in contexts involving the allocation of resources or decision-making criteria ("tips," "to each member's contribution," "based on need").
    - For "justified," it's within a context of explaining criteria ("Pay gaps

Revised Explanation: Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron in layer 22, index 7287, is primarily responsive to linguistic patterns involving distribution, allocation, and justification, particularly in contexts where resources, responsibilities, or decisions are being discussed. The new evidence provides further clarity on the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Activation on Distribution and Allocation**:
    - The neuron shows strong activation in sentences where resources or responsibilities are being distributed or allocated, as seen in examples like "The committee allocated the budget based on each department's needs" (activation: 5.000) and "Resources were distributed to the various branches according to their performance" (activation: 6.000). This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to distribution processes.

2. **Justification Contexts**:
    - The neuron also activates in contexts where decisions are justified, such as "The decision to promote was justified by her consistent achievements and leadership skills" (activation: 5.000). This aligns with the original observation that the neuron responds to justification themes.

3. **Moderate Activation on Responsibility Assignment**:
    - The example "In the meeting, we discussed how responsibilities are assigned to team members" (activation: 2.000) shows a lower activation level, suggesting that while the neuron is somewhat responsive to responsibility assignment, it is less sensitive compared to direct distribution or justification contexts.

4. **Recognition of Efforts**:
    - The sentence "The funds were divided among the
