Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

This neuron in layer 22, index 7287, is primarily responsive to linguistic patterns involving distribution, allocation, and justification, particularly in contexts where resources, responsibilities, or decisions are being discussed. The new evidence provides further clarity on the neuron's activation patterns:

1. **Activation on Distribution and Allocation**:
    - The neuron shows strong activation in sentences where resources or responsibilities are being distributed or allocated, as seen in examples like "The committee allocated the budget based on each department's needs" (activation: 5.000) and "Resources were distributed to the various branches according to their performance" (activation: 6.000). This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to distribution processes.

2. **Justification Contexts**:
    - The neuron also activates in contexts where decisions are justified, such as "The decision to promote was justified by her consistent achievements and leadership skills" (activation: 5.000). This aligns with the original observation that the neuron responds to justification themes.

3. **Moderate Activation on Responsibility Assignment**:
    - The example "In the meeting, we discussed how responsibilities are assigned to team members" (activation: 2.000) shows a lower activation level, suggesting that while the neuron is somewhat responsive to responsibility assignment, it is less sensitive compared to direct distribution or justification contexts.

4. **Recognition of Efforts**:
    - The sentence "The funds were divided among the"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
