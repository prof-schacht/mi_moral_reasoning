=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "This neuron in layer 22, index 7287, appears to respond to linguistic patterns associated with certain prepositions and words that imply distribution, justification, or hierarchical relationships. Let's break down the activation patterns:

1. **Activation on Prepositions and Certain Nouns**:
    - The examples show high activation on tokens like "to," "on," and "of," which are common prepositions. These prepositions are often used in contexts involving relationships, distribution, or explanations.
    - The activation on "tips" in "Distributing tips among tips staff" suggests a pattern where the neuron is sensitive to words part of or related to distribution processes (like how tips are allocated).

2. **Themes of Distribution and Justification**: 
    - The neuron is highly active in contexts involving the allocation of resources or decision-making criteria ("tips," "to each member's contribution," "based on need").
    - For "justified," it's within a context of explaining criteria ("Pay gaps"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee allocated the budget based on each department's needs."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Resources were distributed to the various branches according to their performance."
Activation: 6.000
Text: "The decision to promote was justified by her consistent achievements and leadership skills."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "In the meeting, we discussed how responsibilities are assigned to team members."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The funds were divided among the team to ensure that everyone's efforts were recognized."
Activation: 5.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
