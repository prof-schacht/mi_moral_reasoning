Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron's activations indicate that it responds to linguistic constructions associated with acts of support, assistance, and loyalty, particularly in contexts involving human interactions and emotional or moral support. Let's refine the explanation based on both the original and new evidence:

1. **Human-Centric Support and Assistance:**
   - The neuron consistently activates in contexts where support or assistance is directed towards individuals or groups, as seen in examples like "Offering a helping hand to a colleague in need" and "The community rallied around a family who lost everything in the fire." These examples emphasize direct human support and collective action, which strongly trigger the neuron.

2. **Emotional and Moral Support:**
   - The neuron is sensitive to scenarios that involve emotional or moral support, such as "Standing firm beside a partner during turbulent times" and "The generous donation to the charity was a testament to their commitment to the cause." These contexts highlight loyalty, commitment, and emotional solidarity, aligning with the neuron's activation pattern.

3. **Non-Human Subjects and Indirect Support:**
   - The example "The cat sitting by the window looked as if it was guarding the house" shows that the neuron can activate in contexts involving non-human subjects, but the activation is weaker (3.000) compared to human-centric examples. This suggests that while the neuron can recognize indirect or metaphorical support, it is less sensitive to these scenarios.

4. **Specific Linguistic Constructions:**"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".

    
Text 1: Seven trees rise behind the old library near a red bench.
Activation: 
Text 2: Those battered books perched awkwardly on wide shelves still hold no urgent secrets.
Activation: 
Text 3: Colorful lamps shine nightly beside narrow alleys in quaint squares.
Activation: 
Text 4: Beneath distant clouds, travelers linger casually without urgent tasks ahead.
Activation: 
Text 5: Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.
