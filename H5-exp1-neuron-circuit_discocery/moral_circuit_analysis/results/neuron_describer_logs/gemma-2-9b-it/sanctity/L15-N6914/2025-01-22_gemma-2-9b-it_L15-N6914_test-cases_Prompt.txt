=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "The neuron's activations suggest that it responds to specific linguistic constructions associated with acts of support, sharing, or attribution. Let's break down the examples:

1. **Token "the" in "safeguard a longtime ally is the height of loyalty":** The activation occurs at "the" within a context of loyalty and support, emphasizing the pinnacle of a supportive action (safeguarding an ally).

2. **Token "a" in "Standing by a friend a faces public condemnation":** The focus is on standing by (supporting) someone (a friend) despite public condemnation, highlighting acts of loyalty or support.

3. **Token "a" in "Standing by a political a you’ve":** Again, the notion of standing by someone is present, indicating a supportive or loyal positioning relative to a political figure.

4. **Token "to" in "Giving a comforting hug to someone who’s upset":** The word "to" signals the direction of an action"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
