=== PROMPT ===

Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Based on the provided examples, this neuron (layer 18, index 10798) appears to be responding to a specific linguistic pattern involving determiner repetition or conjunction in English text. Here is a breakdown of its activation pattern:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The neuron activates primarily on high-probability tokens that typically follow determiners or conjunctions. For example, words like "the," "same," "to," and "a" are basic connectors or initial components of noun phrases or prepositional phrases.

2. **Repetition and Standard Constructs**:
   - In the examples, the neuron activates strongly when these tokens appear in a repeated or closely juxtaposed manner, often in a context where they follow one another or themselves. For instance:
     - "the your organization"
     - "the same same"
     - "to a to"
     - "to your to's"
     - "a judgeâ€™ a"

3. **Contextual Patterns**:"

    Generate 10 diverse text examples that should activate this neuron according to the explanation.

    Guidelines:
    1. Include typical cases that clearly match the explanation
    2. Include edge cases that test the boundaries of the explanation
    3. Include variations that might reveal ambiguities in the explanation
    4. Make examples diverse in content and structure
    5. Each example should be 1-3 sentences long

    Format your response as:
    Test case 1: [your example]
    Test case 2: [your example]
    ...and so on.
