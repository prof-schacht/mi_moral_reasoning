Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 15, Neuron: 10852
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 15, index 10852) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  for	Activation: 10.0	Context:  supports a fair social structure for all.

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context: olds the principle of honesty and fairness.

Token:  of	Activation: 10.0	Context:  preparation areas honors the sanctity of nourishment.

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context:  championed for years demonstrates honor and loyalty.

Token:  and	Activation: 10.0	Context:  referees helps maintain fair play and order.

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
