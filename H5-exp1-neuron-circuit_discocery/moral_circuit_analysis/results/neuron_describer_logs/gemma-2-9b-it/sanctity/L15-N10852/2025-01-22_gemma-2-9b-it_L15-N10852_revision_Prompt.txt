=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question (layer 15, index 10852) appears to activate primarily in contexts related to principles or concepts of fairness, honesty, and integrity, specifically when these ideas are linked with social structures, behaviors, or roles. Let's break down the pattern based on the examples provided:

1. **Activation on Conjunctions and Prepositions**:
   - The neuron consistently activates on common conjunctions ("and") and prepositions ("for" and "of"). This suggests that it may be sensitive to connecting phrases that carry thematic importance rather than the specific words themselves.

2. **Semantic Context**:
   - The activations occur in sentences that involve principles such as fairness ("a fair social structure," "maintain fair play"), honesty ("the principle of honesty"), and integrity ("demonstrates honor and loyalty," "honors the sanctity"). These sentences describe either actions promoting these principles or entities embodying them.

3. **Role of Context**:
   - The context around"

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "The committee emphasized the importance of honesty and integrity in maintaining a fair and equitable workplace environment."
Activation: 10.000
Text: "A society thrives when it upholds the values of fairness and justice in its social policies and roles."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "The book discusses the role of integrity in leadership, focusing on how leaders can inspire trust and respect."
Activation: 4.000
Text: "To promote fairness, the rules were designed to ensure equal opportunity for all participants."
Activation: 2.000
Text: "The concept of fairness is central to the philosophy of justice, where each individual's rights are honored and respected."
Activation: 3.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
