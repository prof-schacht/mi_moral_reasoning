Based on this explanation of a neuron's behavior:
    "Revised explanation of neuron behavior:

The neuron located in layer 26 at index 11794 demonstrates activation patterns associated with themes of commitment, continuity, and loyalty, particularly in contexts involving supportive or challenging situations. The new evidence provides further insights into the specific linguistic structures and semantic themes that trigger this neuron, refining our understanding of its behavior.

1. **Supported Aspects:**
   - **Commitment and Dedication:** The neuron consistently activates in contexts where commitment and dedication are highlighted, as seen in phrases like "unwavering loyalty," "commitment to the project," and "dedication to learning." This supports the original explanation that the neuron is sensitive to themes of ongoing support and dedication.
   - **Verb Activation (`Token: shows`)**: The verb "shows" continues to trigger the neuron, especially when it denotes evidence of continuous actions or attributes related to positive traits like dedication, as seen in "shows unwavering loyalty" and "shows signs of dedication."

2. **Modified Aspects:**
   - **Punctuation Activation (`Token: ,`)**: While the original explanation suggested high activation for commas in additive clauses, the new evidence indicates that the presence of commas alone does not significantly influence activation. Instead, the semantic content surrounding the punctuation, particularly phrases indicating sustained support, is more critical.
   - **Preposition Activation (`Token: to`)**: The original explanation did not fully explore the role of prepositions. The new evidence suggests that "to" plays"

    For each of the following texts, predict the neuron's activation on a scale of 0-10,
    where 0 means no activation and 10 means maximum activation.
    Only provide numerical values prefixed with "Activation:".
