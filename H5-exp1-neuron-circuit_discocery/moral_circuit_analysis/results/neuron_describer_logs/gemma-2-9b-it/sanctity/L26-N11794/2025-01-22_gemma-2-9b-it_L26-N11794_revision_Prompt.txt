=== PROMPT ===

Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron in question, located in layer 26 at index 11794, shows a consistent pattern of activation in contexts that suggest themes of commitment, continuity, or loyalty, often in challenging or supportive situations. The prominent activation is linked to linguistic structures and semantic themes that emphasize ongoing support or dedication.

1. **Pattern Detection:**
   - **Punctuation Activation (`Token: ,`)**: The activation is high for commas when they are used as part of a sentence structure that precedes or follows phrases indicating sustained support or a dedicated action. This suggests the neuron is sensitive to additive clauses that provide elaboration or emphasize continuity in actions or sentiments.
   
   - **Verb Activation (`Token: shows`)**: The verb "shows" can highlight demonstrations of ongoing commitment or dedication. This suggests that the neuron detects verbs that denote evidence of continuous actions or attributes, especially those pertaining to positive traits like dedication.

   - **Preposition Activation (`Token: to`)**: The preposition ""

    New evidence from test cases:
    Text: "She shows unwavering loyalty to her friends, always being there in times of need, offering a shoulder to lean on."
Activation: 8.000
Text: "Despite the challenges, the team's commitment to the project never wavered, and they continued to push forward, striving for excellence."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "The relationship between the mentor and mentee, based on mutual respect and continuous guidance, has flourished over the years."
Activation: 3.000
Text: "He shows signs of dedication, consistently volunteering at the shelter every weekend, demonstrating his commitment to the cause."
Activation: 5.000
Text: "Her dedication to learning was evident, as she spent countless hours studying and improving her skills, regardless of the obstacles."
Activation: 6.000

    Based on this new evidence, please provide a revised explanation of the neuron's behavior.
    Consider:
    1. Which aspects of the original explanation are supported by the new evidence?
    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
