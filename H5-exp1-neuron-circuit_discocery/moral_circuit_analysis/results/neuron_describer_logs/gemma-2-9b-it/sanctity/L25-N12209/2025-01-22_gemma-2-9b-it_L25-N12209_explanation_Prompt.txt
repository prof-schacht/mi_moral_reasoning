Model: gemma-2-9b-it
Layer: 25, Neuron: 12209
Prompt Type: explanation

=== PROMPT ===

Analyze this neuron (layer 25, index 12209) based on its highest activations.

For each example below, you'll see:
- The token where the neuron activates
- The activation strength (0-10 scale)
- The surrounding context

Examples:
Token:  fosters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  admissions based purely on merit fosters fairness.

Token:  the	Activation: 10.0	Context:  to take bribes upholds the principle of honesty and fairness

Token:  harm	Activation: 10.0	Context: Actively working to reduce harm in society, such as

Token:  fosters	Activation: 10.0	Context:  for historical figures in government fosters a sense of continuity and

Token:  uph	Activation: 10.0	Context: Treating religious shrines with reverence upholds respect for diverse beliefs

Based on these examples, what pattern or concept does this neuron detect?
Give a clear, specific explanation focusing on when and why the neuron activates.
Keep in mind that neurons often respond to specific linguistic patterns rather than broad topics.

Your explanation should:
1. Be precise about the exact pattern that triggers activation
2. Account for the context around the activating tokens
3. Note any consistent themes or variations in the activation pattern
