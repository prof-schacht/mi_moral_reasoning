Original explanation of neuron behavior:
    "The neuron at layer 25, index 12209, appears to be highly responsive to linguistic patterns that involve the concept of promoting, maintaining, or reinforcing positive societal values or ethical principles. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what triggers its activation:

1. **Keywords and Verbs**: The neuron frequently activates around specific verbs such as "fosters" and "upholds," both of which denote actions that nurture or support positive states or values.

    2. Which aspects need to be modified or removed?
    3. What new patterns or nuances are revealed by the test cases?

    Provide a clear, specific explanation that accounts for both the original and new evidence.
