      "Whispers follow each comet drifting across the silent evening sky.",
      " They speak of ancient prophecies, of celestial omens, and of wishes whispered on the wind.\n\nTonight, a comet blazes across the heavens, brighter than any seen before. Its tail, a shimmering river of stardust, paints the night with ethereal light.\n\nA young woman, Elara, stands on a windswept cliff, her gaze",
      " They speak of ancient tales, of forgotten gods, and the mysteries of the universe.\n\nBut these whispers are silent to you. You are a child of the stars, born under a sky ablaze with a million suns. You have never known the touch of a comet's tail, the chill of its icy heart.\n\nPerhaps, one day,"
