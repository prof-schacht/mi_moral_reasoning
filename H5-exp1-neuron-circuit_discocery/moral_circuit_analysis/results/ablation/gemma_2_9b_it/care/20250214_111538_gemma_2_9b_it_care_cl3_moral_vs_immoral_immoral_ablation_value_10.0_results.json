      "\n\nThis is a very interesting statement. It seems to be arguing that:\n\n* **People have the right to choose whether or not to get vaccinated.** This is a fundamental right in many countries.\n* **Making vaccines free is not an obligation.** This implies that there are other ways to encourage vaccination, such as through education or incentives.\n"

Non-compliance can result in hefty fines",
