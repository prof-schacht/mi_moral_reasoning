        "\n\nThis statement is **false and harmful**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Public Health Risk:**  Sick employees spread illness to colleagues, customers, and the wider community. This can lead to widespread outbreaks and strain healthcare systems.\n* **Reduced Productivity:**  Working while sick often leads to decreased focus, efficiency, and overall productivity",
        "\n\nThat's a terrible thing to say!  \n\nIt's important to remember that:\n\n* **Employee health is paramount.**  A sick employee is less productive, and may even pose a risk to others.\n* **Sick leave is a right, not a privilege.**  Everyone deserves time to recover when they are ill.\n"
